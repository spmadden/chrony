This is the README for chrony.

What is chrony?
===============
Chrony is a pair of programs for maintaining the accuracy of computer
clocks.

chronyd is a (background) daemon program that can be started at boot
time.  This does most of the work.

chronyc is a command-line interface program which can be used to
monitor chronyd's performance and to change various operating
parameters whilst it is running.

chronyd's main function is to obtain measurements of the true (UTC)
time from one of several sources, and correct the system clock
accordingly.  It also works out the rate at which the system clock
gains or loses time and uses this information to keep it accurate
between measurements from the reference.

The reference time can be derived from Network Time Protocol (NTP)
servers, reference clocks, or wristwatch-and-keyboard (via chronyc).
The main source of information about the Network Time Protocol is
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp.

It is designed so that it can work on computers which only have
intermittent access to reference sources, for example computers which
use a dial-up account to access the Internet.  Of course, it will work
on computers with permanent connections too.

In addition, on Linux it can monitor the system's real time clock
performance, so the system can maintain accurate time even across
reboots.

Typical accuracies available between 2 machines are

On an ethernet LAN : 100-200 microseconds, often much better
On a V32bis dial-up modem connection : 10's of milliseconds (from one
session to the next)

With a good reference clock the accuracy can reach one microsecond.

chronyd can also operate as an RFC1305-compatible NTP server and peer.


What will chrony run on?
========================

Chrony can be successfully built and run on

1. Linux v1.2.13, v2.0.x, 2.1.x (partially), 2.2.x, 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.6.x.
Real time clock support is limited to 2.0.32 onwards and to 2.2, 2.3,
2.4 and 2.6 series only.  i386, x86_64, PowerPC are known to be
supported.

2. Solaris 2.5/2.5.1/2.6/2.7/2.8 (various platforms) 

3. SunOS 4.1.4 (Sparc 2 and Sparc 20)

4. BSD/386 v1.1 has been reported to work using the SunOS 4.1 driver.

5. NetBSD.

Any other system will require a porting exercise.  You would need to
start from one of the existing system-specific drivers and look into
the quirks of certain system calls and the kernel on your target
system.  (This is described in the manual).

How do I set it up?
===================

The file INSTALL gives instructions.  On supported systems the
compilation process should be automatic.

You will need an ANSI C compiler -- gcc is recommended.

The manual (in texinfo and text formats) describes how to set the
software up for the less straightforward cases.

What documentation is there?
============================

A manual is supplied in Texinfo format (chrony.texi) and
ready-formatted plain text (chrony.txt) in the distribution.

There is also information available on the chrony web pages, accessible
through the URL 

    http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/

What can chrony not do?
=======================

Compared to the `reference' RFC1305 implementation xntpd, chronyd does
not support broadcast modes.

Where are new versions announced?
=================================

There is a low volume mailing list where new versions and other
important news relating to chrony is announced.  You can join this list
by sending mail with the subject "subscribe" to

chrony-announce-request@chrony.tuxfamily.org

These messages will be copied to chrony-users (see below).  New versions
are announced also on Freshmeat (http://freshmeat.net/).

How can I get support for chrony?
and where can I discuss new features, possible bugs etc?
========================================================

There are 3 mailing lists relating to chrony.  chrony-announce was
mentioned above.  chrony-users is a users' discussion list, e.g. for
general questions and answers about using chrony.  chrony-dev is a more
technical list, e.g. for discussing how new features should be
implemented, exchange of information between developers etc.  To
subscribe to either of these lists, send a message with the subject
"subscribe" to

chrony-users-request@chrony.tuxfamily.org
or
chrony-dev-request@chrony.tuxfamily.org

as applicable.
