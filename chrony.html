<h3 class="section">1.1 Overview</h3>

<p>Chrony is a software package for maintaining the accuracy of computer
system clocks.  It consists of a pair of programs :

     <ul>
<li><code>chronyd</code>.  This is a daemon which runs in background on the
system.  It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's
offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system time
accordingly.  For isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the
correct time by hand (using <code>chronyc</code>).  In either case,
<code>chronyd</code> determines the rate at which the computer gains or loses
time, and compensates for this.

     <p><code>chronyd</code> can also act as an NTP server, and provide a time-of-day service
to other computers.  A typical set-up is to run <code>chronyd</code> on a gateway
computer that has a dial-up link to the Internet, and use it to serve time to
computers on a private LAN sitting behind the gateway.  The IP addresses that
can act as clients of <code>chronyd</code> can be tightly controlled.  The default is
no client access.

     <li><code>chronyc</code>.  This is a command-line driven control and
monitoring program.  An administrator can use this to fine-tune various
parameters within the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the
daemon is running.

     <p>The IP addresses from which <code>chronyc</code> clients may connect can be tightly
controlled.  The default is just the computer that <code>chronyd</code> itself is
running on. 
</ul>

<p>The <code>chrony</code> suite makes use of the algorithm known as <em>RSA
Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm</em> for authenticating
messages between different machines on the network.

   <p>In writing the <code>chronyd</code> program, extensive use has been made of
RFC1305, written by David Mills.  I have occasionally referred to the
<code>xntp</code> suite's source code to check details of the protocol that
the RFC did not make absolutely clear.  The core algorithms in
<code>chronyd</code> are all completely distinct from <code>xntp</code>, however.

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.2 Platforms</h4>

<p>Although most of the program is portable between
Unix-like systems, there are parts that have to be tailored to each
specific vendor's system.  These are the parts that interface with the
operating system's facilities for adjusting the system clock;
different operating systems may provide different function calls to
achieve this, and even where the same function is used it may have
different quirks in its behaviour.

   <p>The software is known to work in the following environments:
     <ul>
<li>Linux/i386 and Linux/ppc.  The software is known to work on Linux 2.0.x,
2.2.x and 2.4.x.  Prior to 2.0.31, the real time clock can't be used.

     <li>NetBSD
<li>BSD/386

     <li>Solaris 2.3/2.5/2.5.1/2.6/2.7/2.8 on Sparc (Sparc 20, Ultrasparc) and
i386

     <li>SunOS 4.1.4 on Sparc 2 and Sparc20. 
</ul>

   <p>Closely related systems may work too, but they have not been tested.

   <p>Porting the software to other system (particularly to those supporting
an <code>adjtime</code> system call) should not be difficult, however it
requires access to such systems to test out the driver.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.1 xntpd</h4>

<p>The `reference' implementation of the Network Time Protocol is the
program <code>xntpd</code>, available via
<a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp">The NTP home page</a>.

   <p><code>xntpd</code> is designed to support all the operating modes defined by
RFC1305, and has driver support for a large number of reference clocks
(such as GPS receivers) that can be connected directly to a computer,
thereby providing a so-called 'stratum 1' server.

   <p>Things <code>chronyd</code> can do that <code>xntpd</code> can't:

     <ul>
<li><code>chronyd</code> can perform usefully in an environment where access to
the time reference is intermittent.  <code>chronyd</code> estimates
<em>both</em> the current time offset <em>and</em> the rate at which the
computer's clock gains or loses time, and can use that rate estimate to
trim the clock after the reference disappears.  <code>xntpd</code> corrects
any time offset by speeding up and slowing down the computer clock, and
so could be left with a significant rate error if the reference
disappears whilst it is trying to correct a big offset.

     <li><code>chronyd</code> provides support for isolated networks whether the only
method of time correction is manual entry (e.g. by the administrator
looking at a clock).  <code>chronyd</code> can look at the errors corrected at
different updates to work out the rate at which the computer gains or
loses time, and use this estimate to trim the computer clock
subsequently.

     <li><code>chronyd</code> provides support to work out the gain or loss rate of the
`real-time clock', i.e. the clock that maintains the time when the
computer is turned off.  It can use this data when the system boots to
set the system time from a corrected version of the real-time clock. 
These real-time clock facilities are only available on certain releases
of Linux, so far.

     <li>The <code>xntpd</code> program is supported by other programs to carry out
certain functions.  <code>ntpdate</code> is used to provide an initial
correction to the system clock based on a `one-shot' sampling of other
NTP servers.  <code>tickadj</code> is used to adjust certain operating system
parameters to make <code>xntpd</code> work better.  All this functionality is
integrated into <code>chronyd</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Things <code>xntpd</code> can do that <code>chronyd</code> can't:

     <ul>
<li><code>xntpd</code> supports a range of different hardware reference clocks
(GPS, atomic etc) that can be connected to a computer to provide a
`stratum-1' server.  <code>chronyd</code> does not support any such hardware
<em>yet</em>; I don't have access to any to do any development work. 
However, the software architecture should allow such equipment to be
interfaced at a later date.

     <li><code>xntpd</code> supports effectively all of RFC1305, including broadcast /
multicast clients, leap seconds, and extra encryption schemes for
authenticating data packets.

     <li><code>xntpd</code> has been ported to more types of computer / operating
system (so far).

     <li>xntpd is designed to work solely with integer arithmetic (i.e. does not
require floating point support from its host).

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.2 timed</h4>

<p><code>timed</code> is a program that is part of the BSD networking suite.  It
uses broadcast packets to find all machines running the daemon within a
subnet.  The machines elect a master which periodically measures the
system clock offsets of the other computers using ICMP timestamps. 
Corrections are sent to each member as a result of this process.

   <p>Problems that may arise with <code>timed</code> are :

     <ul>
<li>Because it uses broadcasts, it is not possible to isolate its
functionality to a particular group of computers; there is a risk of
upsetting other computers on the same network (e.g. where a whole
company is on the same subnet but different departments are independent
from the point of view of administering their computers.) 
<li>The update period appears to be 10 minutes.  Computers can build up
significant offsets relative to each other in that time.  If a
computer can estimate its rate of drift it can keep itself closer to
the other computers between updates by adjusting its clock every few
seconds.  <code>timed</code> does not seem to do this. 
<li><code>timed</code> does not have any integrated capability for feeding
real-time into its estimates, or for estimating the average rate of time
loss/gain of the machines relative to real-time (unless one of the
computers in the group has access to an external reference and is always
appointed as the `master'). 
</ul>

   <p><code>timed</code> does have the benefit over <code>chronyd</code> that for isolated
networks of computers, they will track the `majority vote' time.  For
such isolated networks, <code>chronyd</code> requires one computer to be the
`master' with the others slaved to it.  If the master has a particular
defective clock, the whole set of computers will tend to slip relative
to real time (but they <em>will</em> stay accurate relative to one
another).

<h3 class="section">1.6 Bug reporting and suggestions</h3>

<p>If you think you've found a bug in chrony, or have a suggestion, please let me
know.  My primary current email address is <a href="mailto:rc@rc0.org.uk">rc@rc0.org.uk</a>.  If that
fails, you could try finding me through one of the chrony mailing lists, or by
looking up my name on a search engine.

   <p>I can't promise a timescale to fix a bug; it depends a lot on the how complex
the bug is to track down, as I have a lot of other calls on my time : 2 young
children, my job, and indeed other free/open source software projects. 
However, I do intend to look into problems when time allows.

   <p>Another source of information to try is the chrony users mailing list.  You can
join this by sending an empty message to
<a href="mailto:chrony-users-subscribe@sunsite.dk">chrony-users-subscribe@sunsite.dk</a>.  Only subscribers can post to
the list.

   <p>When you are reporting a bug, please send me all the information you can. 
Unfortunately, chrony has proven to be one of those programs where it is very
difficult to reproduce bugs in a different environment.  So I may have to
interact with you quite a lot to obtain enough extra logging and tracing to
pin-point the problem in some cases.  Please be patient and plan for this!

   <p>Of course, if you can debug the problem yourself and send me a source code
patch to fix it, I will be very grateful!

<h3 class="section">1.7 Contributions</h3>

<p>Although chrony is now a fairly mature and established project, there are still
areas that could be improved.  If you can program in C and have some expertise
in these areas, you might be able to fill the gaps.

   <p>Particular areas I know need addressing are :

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Porting to other Unices

     <p>This involves creating equivalents of sys_solaris.c, sys_linux.c etc for the
new system.  Note, the Linux driver has been reported as working on a range of
different architectures (Alpha, Sparc, MIPS as well as x86 of course).

     <li>Porting to Windows NT

     <p>I did a small amount of work on this under Cygwin.  Only the sorting out of the
include files has really been achieved so far.  The two main areas still to
address are

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The system clock driver. 
<li>How to make chronyd into an NT service (i.e. what to replace fork(),
setsid() etc with so that chronyd can be automatically started in the system
bootstrap.
          </ol>

     <li>Hardware clock support

     <li>Automation of the trimrtc and writertc mechanisms

     <p>Currently, the RTC trimming mechanism is a manual operation, because there has
to be a reasonable guarantee that the system will stay up for a reasonable
length of time afterwards.  (If it is shut down too soon, a poor
characterisation of the RTC drift rate will be stored on disc, giving a bad
system clock error when the system is next booted.)

     <p>To make chrony more automated for the non-expert user, it would be useful if
this problem could be avoided so that trimrtc could be done automatically (e.g. 
in a crontab, or as part of the ip-up or ip-down scripts.)

        </ol>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Installation</h2>

<!-- {{{ main introduction text -->
<p>The software is distributed as source code which has to be compiled. 
The source code is supplied in the form of a gzipped tar file, which
unpacks to a subdirectory identifying the name and version of the
program.

   <p>After unpacking the source code, change directory into it, and type

<pre class="example">     ./configure
</pre>
   <p>This is a shell script that automatically determines the system type. 
There is a single optional parameter, <code>--prefix</code> which indicates
the directory tree where the software should be installed.  For example,

<pre class="example">     ./configure --prefix=/opt/free
</pre>
   <p>will install the <code>chronyd</code> daemon into /opt/free/sbin and the
chronyc control program into /opt/free/bin.  The default value for the
prefix is /usr/local.

   <p>The configure script assumes you want to use gcc as your compiler. 
If you want to use a different compiler, you can configure this way:

<pre class="example">     CC=cc CFLAGS=-O ./configure --prefix=/opt/free
</pre>
   <p>for Bourne-family shells, or

<pre class="example">     setenv CC cc
     setenv CFLAGS -O
     ./configure --prefix=/opt/free
</pre>
   <p>for C-family shells.

   <p>If the software cannot (yet) be built on your system, an error message
will be shown.  Otherwise, the files <samp><span class="file">options.h</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> will be generated.

   <p>By default, chronyc will be built to make use of the readline library.  If you
don't want this, specify the &ndash;disable-readline flag to configure.  If you have
readline and/or ncurses installed in a non-standard location, please refer to
see <a href="#readline-support">readline support</a> for information.

   <p>Now type

<pre class="example">     make
</pre>
   <p>to build the programs.

   <p>If you want to build the manual in plain text, HTML and info versions, type

<pre class="example">     make docs
</pre>
   <p>Once the programs have been successfully compiled, they need to be
installed in their target locations.  This step normally needs to be
performed by the superuser, and requires the following command to be
entered.

<pre class="example">     make install
</pre>
   <p>This will install the binaries, plain text manual and manpages.

   <p>To install the HTML and info versions of the manual as well, enter the command

<pre class="example">     make install-docs
</pre>
   <p>If you want chrony to appear in the top level info directory listing, you need
to run the <samp><span class="command">install-info</span></samp> command manually after this step. 
<samp><span class="command">install-info</span></samp> takes 2 arguments.  The first is the path to the
<samp><span class="file">chrony.info</span></samp> file you have just installed.  This will be the argument you
gave to &ndash;prefix when you configured (<samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> by default), with
<samp><span class="file">/info/chrony.info</span></samp> on the end.  The second argument is the location of
the file called <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp>.  This will typically be <samp><span class="file">/usr/info/dir</span></samp>.  So
the typical command line would be

<pre class="example">     install-info /usr/local/info/chrony.info /usr/info/dir
</pre>
   <p>Now that the software is successfully installed, the next step is to
set up a configuration file.  The contents of this depend on the
network environment in which the computer operates.  The Debian
package installs a simple configuration file suitable for a dial-up
pc.  You should edit it to suit your situation.  Typical scenarios are
described in the following section of the document.

<p>By default, chronyc is built to make use of the readline library.  This allows
you to use the cursor keys to replay and edit old commands.  If you don't want
to use readline (in which case chronyc will use a minimal command line
interface), invoke configure like this:

<pre class="example">     ./configure --disable-readline other-options...
</pre>
   <p>If you have readline and/or ncurses installed in locations that aren't normally searched by the compiler and linker, you need extra options if you want readline to be used:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--with-readline-includes=directory_name</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This defines the name of the directory above the one where <samp><span class="file">readline.h</span></samp>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Extra options for package builders</h3>

<p>The configure and make procedures have some extra options that may be useful if
you are building a distribution package for chrony.

   <p>The &ndash;infodir=DIR option to configure specifies a different install directory
for the info files.  This overrides the <samp><span class="file">info</span></samp> subdirectory of the
argument to the &ndash;prefix option.  For example, you might use

<pre class="example">     ./configure --prefix=/usr --infodir=/usr/share/info
</pre>
   <p>The &ndash;mandir=DIR option to configure specifies a different install directory
for the man pages.  This overrides the <samp><span class="file">man</span></samp> subdirectory of the
argument to the &ndash;prefix option.

<pre class="example">     ./configure --prefix=/usr --infodir=/usr/share/info --mandir=/usr/share/man

   <p>to set both options together.

   <p>The final option is the DESTDIR option to the make command.  For example, you
could use the commands

<h3 class="section">3.1 Computers connected to the internet</h3>

<p>In this section we discuss how to configure chrony for computers that
have permanent connections to the internet (or to any network
containing true NTP servers which ultimately derive their time from a
reference clock).

   <p>To operate in this mode, you will need to know the names of the NTP
server machines you wish to use.  You may be able to find names of
suitable servers by one of the following methods:

     <ul>
<li>Your institution may already operate servers on its network. 
Contact your system administrator to find out.

     <li>Your ISP probably has one or more NTP servers available for its
customers.

     <li>Somewhere under the NTP homepage there is a list of public
stratum 1 and stratum 2 servers.  You should find one or more servers
that are near to you &mdash; check that their access policy allows you to
use their facilities. 
</ul>

   <p>Assuming that you have found some servers, you need to set up a
configuration file to run chrony.  The (compiled-in) default location
for this file is <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.conf</span></samp>.  In the Debian package the
configuration files are in the directory <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony</span></samp>.  Assuming
that your ntp servers are called <code>a.b.c</code> and <code>d.e.f</code>, your
<samp><span class="file">chrony.conf</span></samp> file could contain as a minimum

<pre class="example">     server a.b.c
     server d.e.f
     server g.h.i
</pre>
   <p>However, you will probably want to include some of the other directives
described later.  The following directives will be particularly useful :
<code>driftfile</code>, <code>commandkey</code>, <code>keyfile</code>.  The smallest
useful configuration file would look something like

<pre class="example">     server a.b.c
     server d.e.f
     server g.h.i
     keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
     commandkey 1
     driftfile /etc/chrony.drift

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.1 Setting up the configuration file for infrequent connections</h4>

<p>As in the previous section, you will need access to NTP servers on the
internet.  The same remarks apply for how to find them.

   <p>In this case, you will need some additional configuration to tell
<code>chronyd</code> when the connection to the internet goes up and down. 
This saves the program from continuously trying to poll the servers when
they are inaccessible.

   <p>Again, assuming that your ntp servers are called <code>a.b.c</code> and
<code>d.e.f</code>, your <samp><span class="file">chrony.conf</span></samp> file would need to contain
something like

<pre class="example">     server a.b.c
     server d.e.f
     server g.h.i
</pre>
   <p>However, the following issues need to be addressed:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Your computer probably doesn't have DNS access whilst offline to turn
the machine names into IP addresses. 
<li>Your computer will keep trying to contact the servers to obtain
timestamps, even whilst offline.  If you operate a dial-on-demand
system, things are even worse, because the link to the internet will
keep getting established.
        </ol>

   <p>For this reason, it would be better to specify this part of your
configuration file in the following way:

<pre class="example">     server 1.2.3.4 offline
     server 5.6.7.8 offline
     server 9.10.11.12 offline
</pre>
   <p>Because numeric IP addresses have been used, the first problem is
overcome.  The <code>offline</code> keyword indicates that the servers start
in an offline state, and that they should not be contacted until <code>chronyd</code>
receives notification that the link to the internet is present.

   <p>An alternative is to use the names of the NTP servers, and put entries for them
into your <samp><span class="file">/etc/hosts</span></samp> file.  This will be OK as long as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">files</span></samp>&rsquo;
comes before &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dns</span></samp>&rsquo; in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hosts</span></samp>&rsquo; line of the
<samp><span class="file">/etc/nsswitch.conf</span></samp> file.

   <p>In order to notify <code>chronyd</code> of the presence of the link, you
will need to be able to log in to it with the program chronyc.  To do
this, <code>chronyd</code> needs to be configured with an administrator
password.  The Debian package puts a randomly generated key in
<samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony/chrony.keys</span></samp>.  You should change it.  To set up an
administrator password, you can create a file <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.keys</span></samp>
containing a single line

<pre class="example">     1 xyzzy
</pre>
   <p>and add the following line to <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.conf</span></samp> (the order of the
lines does not matter)

<pre class="example">     commandkey 1
</pre>
   <p>The smallest useful configuration file would look something like

<pre class="example">     server 1.2.3.4 offline
     server 5.6.7.8 offline
     server 9.10.11.12 offline
     keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
     commandkey 1
     driftfile /etc/chrony.drift
</pre>
   <p>The next section describes how to tell <code>chronyd</code> when the internet link
goes up and down.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.2 How to tell chronyd when the internet link is available.</h4>

<p>To use this option, you will need to configure a command key in
<code>chronyd's</code> configuration file <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.conf</span></samp>, as described in
the previous section.

   <p>To tell <code>chronyd</code> when to start and finish sampling the servers, the
<code>online</code> and <code>offline</code> commands of chronyc need to be used. 
To give an example of their use, we assume that <code>pppd</code> is the
program being used to connect to the internet, and that chronyc has been
installed at its default location <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/chronyc</span></samp>.  We
also assume that the command key has been set up as described in the
previous section.

   <p>In the file <samp><span class="file">/etc/ppp/ip-up</span></samp> we add the command sequence

<pre class="example">     /usr/local/bin/chronyc &lt;&lt;EOF
     password xyzzy
     online
     EOF
</pre>
   <p>and in the file <samp><span class="file">/etc/ppp/ip-down</span></samp> we add the sequence

<pre class="example">     /usr/local/bin/chronyc &lt;&lt;EOF
     password xyzzy
     offline
     EOF
</pre>
   <p>The Debian package puts scripts similar to those above in the
directories <samp><span class="file">/etc/ppp/ip-up.d</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/etc/ppp/ip-down.d</span></samp>.

   <p><code>chronyd's</code> polling of the servers will now only occur whilst the
machine is actually connected to the Internet.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Isolated networks</h3>

<p>In this section we discuss how to configure chrony for computers that
never have network conectivity to any computer which ultimately derives
its time from a reference clock.

   <p>In this situation, one computer is selected to be the master timeserver. 
The other computers are either direct clients of the master, or clients
of clients.

   <p>The rate value in the master's drift file needs to be set to the average
rate at which the master gains or loses time.  <code>chronyd</code> includes
support for this, in the form of the <code>manual</code> directive in the
configuration file and the <code>settime</code> command in the <code>chronyc</code>
program.

   <p>If the master is rebooted, <code>chronyd</code> can re-read the drift rate
from the drift file.  However, the master has no accurate estimate of
the current time.  To get around this, the system can be configured so
that the master can initially set itself to a `majority-vote' of
selected clients' times; this allows the clients to `flywheel' the
master across its outage.

   <p>A typical configuration file for the master (called <code>master</code>) might
be (assuming the clients are in the 192.168.165.x subnet and that the
master's address is 192.168.169.170)

<pre class="example">     driftfile /etc/chrony.drift
     commandkey 25
     keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
     initstepslew 10 client1 client3 client6
     local stratum 8
     manual
     allow 192.168.165
</pre>
   <p>For the clients that have to resynchronise the master when it restarts,
the configuration file might be

<pre class="example">     server master
     driftfile /etc/chrony.drift
     logdir /var/log/chrony
     log measurements statistics tracking
     keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
     commandkey 24
     local stratum 10
     initstepslew 20 master
     allow 192.168.169.170
</pre>
   <p>The rest of the clients would be the same, except that the <code>local</code>
and <code>allow</code> directives are not required.

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.1 Assumptions/how the software works</h4>

<p>This section considers the home computer which has a dial-up connection. 
It assumes that Linux is run exclusively on the computer.  Dual-boot
systems may work; it depends what (if anything) the other system does to
the system's real-time clock.

   <p>Much of the configuration for this case is discussed earlier
(see <a href="#Infrequent-connection">Infrequent connection</a>).  This section addresses specifically
the case of a computer which is turned off between 'sessions'.

   <p>In this case, <code>chronyd</code> relies on the computer's real-time clock
(RTC) to maintain the time between the periods when it is powered up. 
The arrangement is shown in the figure below.

<pre class="example">                 trim if required                          PSTN

                                                       |NTP server|
                                                       +----------+
</pre>
   <p>When the computer is connected to the Internet (via the modem),
<code>chronyd</code> has access to external NTP servers which it makes
measurements from.  These measurements are saved, and straight-line fits
are performed on them to provide an estimate of the computer's time
error and rate of gaining/losing time.

   <p>When the computer is taken offline from the Internet, the best estimate
of the gain/loss rate is used to free-run the computer until it next
goes online.

   <p>Whilst the computer is running, <code>chronyd</code> makes measurements of the
real-time clock (RTC) (via the <samp><span class="file">/dev/rtc</span></samp> interface, which must be
compiled into the kernel).  An estimate is made of the RTC error at a
particular RTC second, and the rate at which the RTC gains or loses time
relative to true time.

   <p>The RTC is fully supported in 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.

   <p>On 2.6 kernels, if your motherboard has a HPET, you need to enable the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">HPET_EMULATE_RTC</span></samp>&rsquo; option in your kernel configuration.  Otherwise, chrony
will not be able to interact with the RTC device and will give up using it.

   <p>For kernels in the 2.0 series prior to 2.0.32, the kernel was set up to
trim the RTC every 11 minutes.  This would be disasterous for
<code>chronyd</code> &ndash; there is no reliable way of synchronising with this
trimming. For this reason, <code>chronyd</code> only supports the RTC in 2.0
kernels from v2.0.32 onwards.

   <p>When the computer is powered down, the measurement histories for all the
NTP servers are saved to files (if the <code>dumponexit</code> directive is
specified in the configuration file), and the RTC tracking information
is also saved to a file (if the <code>rtcfile</code> directive has been
specified).  These pieces of information are also saved if the
<code>dump</code> and <code>writertc</code> commands respectively are issued through
<code>chronyc</code>.

   <p>When the computer is rebooted, <code>chronyd</code> reads the current RTC time
and the RTC information saved at the last shutdown.  This information is
used to set the system clock to the best estimate of what its time would
have been now, had it been left running continuously.  The measurement
histories for the servers are then reloaded.

   <p>The next time the computer goes online, the previous sessions'
measurements can contribute to the line-fitting process, which gives a
much better estimate of the computer's gain/loss rate.

   <p>One problem with saving the measurements and RTC data when the machine
is shut down is what happens if there is a power failure; the most
recent data will not be saved.  Although <code>chronyd</code> is robust enough
to cope with this, some performance may be lost.  (The main danger
arises if the RTC has been changed during the session, with the
<code>trimrtc</code> command in <code>chronyc</code>.  Because of this,
<code>trimrtc</code> will make sure that a meaningful RTC file is saved out
after the change is completed).

   <p>The easiest protection against power failure is to put the <code>dump</code>
and <code>writertc</code> commands in the same place as the <code>offline</code>
command is issued to take <code>chronyd</code> offline; because <code>chronyd</code>
free-runs between online sessions, no parameters will change
significantly between going offline from the Internet and any power
failure.

   <p>A final point regards home computers which are left running for extended
periods and where it is desired to spin down the hard disc when it is
not in use (e.g. when not accessed for 15 minutes).  <code>chronyd</code> has
been planned so it supports such operation; this is the reason why the
RTC tracking parameters are not saved to disc after every update, but
only when the user requests such a write, or during the shutdown
sequence.  The only other facility that will generate periodic writes to
the disc is the <code>log rtc</code> facility in the configuration file; this
option should not be used if you want your disc to spin down.

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.2 Typical configuration files.</h4>

<p>To illustrate how a dial-up home computer might be configured, example
configuration files are shown in this section.

   <p>For the <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.conf</span></samp> file, the following can be used as an
example.  <em>NOTE : The </em><code>server</code><em> directives are only applicable
to customers of Demon Internet; users of other ISPs will need to use
their own ISP's NTP servers or public NTP servers.</em>

<pre class="example">     server 158.152.1.65 minpoll 5 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 0.4 offline
     server 158.152.1.76 minpoll 5 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 0.4 offline
     server 194.159.253.2 minpoll 5 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 0.4 offline
     logdir /var/log/chrony
     log statistics measurements tracking
     driftfile /etc/chrony.drift
     keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
     commandkey 25
     maxupdateskew 100.0
     dumponexit
     dumpdir /var/log/chrony
     rtcfile /etc/chrony.rtc
</pre>
   <p>With Freeserve as the ISP, I use the following server lines :

<pre class="example">     server 194.152.64.68 minpoll 5 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 0.4 offline
     server 194.152.64.35 minpoll 5 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 0.4 offline
     server 194.152.64.34 minpoll 5 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 0.4 offline
</pre>
   <p>I use <code>pppd</code> for connecting to my ISP.  This runs two scripts
<samp><span class="file">/etc/ppp/ip-up</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/etc/ppp/ip-down</span></samp> when the link goes
online and offline respectively.

   <p>The relevant part of the <samp><span class="file">/etc/ppp/ip-up</span></samp> file is (with a dummy
password)

<pre class="example">     /usr/local/bin/chronyc &lt;&lt;EOF
     password xxxxxxxx
     online
     EOF
</pre>
   <p>and the relevant part of the <samp><span class="file">/etc/ppp/ip-down</span></samp> script is

<pre class="example">     /usr/local/bin/chronyc &lt;&lt;EOF
     password xxxxxxxx
     offline
     dump
     writertc
     EOF
</pre>
   <p>(Because they have to contain the administrator password, it would be
desirable to make the files readable only by root on a multiuser
machine).

   <p>To start <code>chronyd</code> during the boot sequence, I have the following
in <samp><span class="file">/etc/rc.d/rc.local</span></samp> (this is a Slackware system)

<pre class="example">     if [ -f /usr/local/sbin/chronyd -a -f /etc/chrony.conf ]; then
       /usr/local/sbin/chronyd -r -s
       echo "Start chronyd"
     fi
</pre>
   <p>The Debian package puts a script which handles this and shutdown in
<samp><span class="file">/etc/init.d/chrony</span></samp>.

   <p>The placement of this command may be important on some systems.  In
particular, <code>chronyd</code> may need to be started several seconds (about
10 as a minimum) before any software that depends on the system clock
not jumping or moving backwards, depending on the directives in
<code>chronyd's</code> configuration file.

   <p>For the system shutdown, <code>chronyd</code> should receive a SIGTERM several
seconds before the final SIGKILL; the SIGTERM causes the measurement
histories and RTC information to be saved out.  There should be no need
to add anything to the shutdown sequence, unless (as my system had)
there is no pause between the SIGTERM and SIGKILL being delivered to the
remaining processes.  So if you find something like

<pre class="example">     killall5 -15
     killall5 -9
</pre>
   <p>in your <code>/etc/rc.d/rc.0</code> script, you will need to insert a sleep, e.g.

<pre class="example">     killall5 -15
     sleep 5
     killall5 -9
</pre>
   <p>Otherwise, <code>chronyd</code> will not always save information on shutdown,
which could be a problem if you don't use <code>dump</code> and
<code>writertc</code> when you go offline.

<h3 class="section">3.5 Other important configuration options</h3>

<p>The most common option to include in the configuration file is the
<code>driftfile</code> option.  One of the major tasks of <code>chronyd</code> is to
work out how fast or how slow the system clock runs relative to real
time - e.g. in terms of seconds gained or lost per day.  Measurements
over a long period are usually required to refine this estimate to an
acceptable degree of accuracy.  Therefore, it would be bad if
<code>chronyd</code> had to work the value out each time it is restarted,
because the system clock would not run so accurately whilst the
determination is taking place.

   <p>To avoid this problem, <code>chronyd</code> allows the gain or loss rate to be
stored in a file, which can be read back in when the program is
restarted.  This file is called the drift file, and might typically be
stored in <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.drift</span></samp>.  By specifying an option like the
following

<pre class="example">     driftfile /etc/chrony.drift
</pre>
   <p>in the configuration file (<samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.conf</span></samp>), the drift file
facility will be activated.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Starting chronyd</h3>

<p>If <code>chronyd</code> has been installed to its default location
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/sbin/chronyd</span></samp>, starting it is simply a matter of
entering the command

<pre class="example">     /usr/local/sbin/chronyd
</pre>
   <p>The Debian package uses <samp><span class="file">/usr/sbin/chronyd</span></samp>.

   <p>Information messages and warnings will be logged to syslog.

   <p>The command line options supported are as follows:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-d</code><dd>When run in this mode, the program will not detach itself from the
terminal, and all messages will be sent to the terminal instead of to
syslog. 
<br><dt><code>-f &lt;conf-file&gt;</code><dd>This option can be used to specify an alternate location for the
configuration file (default <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.conf</span></samp>). 
<br><dt><code>-r</code><dd>This option will reload sample histories for each of the servers being
used.  These histories are created by using the <code>dump</code> command in
<code>chronyc</code>, or by setting the <code>dumponexit</code> directive in the
configuration file.  This option is useful if you want to stop and
restart <code>chronyd</code> briefly for any reason, e.g. to install a new
version.  However, it only makes sense on systems where the kernel can
maintain clock compensation whilst not under <code>chronyd's</code> control. 
The only version where this happens so far is Linux.  On systems where
this is not the case, e.g. Solaris and SunOS the option should not be
used. 
<br><dt><code>-s</code><dd>This option will set the system clock from the computer's real-time
clock.  This is analogous to supplying the `-s' flag to the
<samp><span class="file">/sbin/clock</span></samp> program during the Linux boot sequence.

     <p>Support for real-time clocks is limited at present - the criteria are
described in the section on the <code>rtcfile</code> directive (see <a href="#rtcfile-directive">rtcfile directive</a>).

     <p>If <code>chronyd</code> cannot support the real time clock on your computer,
this option cannot be used and a warning message will be logged to the
syslog.

     <p>If used in conjunction with the `-r' flag, <code>chronyd</code> will attempt
to preserve the old samples after setting the system clock from the real
time clock.  This can be used to allow <code>chronyd</code> to perform long
term averaging of the gain or loss rate across system reboots, and is
useful for dial-up systems that are shut down when not in use.  For this
to work well, it relies on <code>chronyd</code> having been able to determine
accurate statistics for the difference between the real time clock and
system clock last time the computer was on.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd>This option displays <code>chronyd's</code> version number to the terminal and
exits. 
</dl>

   <p>On systems that support an <samp><span class="file">/etc/rc.local</span></samp> file for starting
programs at boot time, <code>chronyd</code> can be started from there.

   <p>On systems with a System V style initialisation (e.g. Solaris), a
suitable start/stop script might be as shown below.  This might be
placed in the file <samp><span class="file">/etc/rc2.d/S83chrony</span></samp>.

<pre class="example">     #!/bin/sh
     # This file should have uid root, gid sys and chmod 744
     #
     
     killproc() {            # kill the named process(es)
             pid=`/usr/bin/ps -e |
                  /usr/bin/grep -w $1 |
                  /usr/bin/sed -e 's/^  *//' -e 's/ .*//'`
             [ "$pid" != "" ] &amp;&amp; kill $pid
     }
     
     case "$1" in
     
     'start')
        if [ -f /opt/free/sbin/chronyd -a -f /etc/chrony.conf ]; then
          /opt/free/sbin/chronyd
        fi
        ;;
     'stop')
        killproc chronyd
        ;;
     *)
        echo "Usage: /etc/rc2.d/S83chrony { start | stop }"
        ;;
     esac
</pre>
   <p>(In both cases, you may want to bear in mind that <code>chronyd</code> can
step the time when it starts.  There may be other programs started at
boot time that could be upset by this, so you may need to consider the
ordering carefully.  However, <code>chronyd</code> will need to start after
daemons providing services that it may require, e.g. the domain name
service.)

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.2 acquisitionport</h4>

<p><code>chronyd</code> uses a separate client-side port for the rapid-fire
measurements requested with the <code>initstepslew</code> directive
(see <a href="#initstepslew-directive">initstepslew directive</a>).  Normally, that port is chosen
arbitrarily by the operating system.  However, you can use
<code>acquisitionport</code> to explicitly specify a port.  This may be useful
for getting through firewalls.

   <p>Do not make acquisition and regular NTP service (see <a href="#port-directive">port directive</a>)
use the same port.

   <p>An example of the <code>acquisitionport</code> command is

<pre class="example">     acquisitionport 1123
</pre>
   <p>This would change the port used for rapid queries to udp/1123.  You
could then persuade the firewall administrator to let that port through.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.3 allow</h4>

<p>The <code>allow</code> command is used to designate a particular subnet from
which NTP clients are allowed to access the computer as an NTP server.

   <p>The default is that no clients are allowed access, i.e. <code>chronyd</code>
operates purely as an NTP client.  If the <code>allow</code> directive is
used, <code>chronyd</code> will be both a client of its servers, and a server
to other clients.

   <p>Examples of use of the command are as follows:

<pre class="example">     allow foo.bar.com
     allow 1.2
     allow 3.4.5
     allow 6.7.8/22
     allow 6.7.8.9/22
     allow
</pre>
   <p>The first command allows the named node to be an NTP client of this computer. 
The second command allows any node with an IP address of the form 1.2.x.y (with
x and y arbitrary) to be an NTP client of this computer.  Likewise, the third
command allows any node with an IP address of the form 3.4.5.x to have client
NTP access.  The fourth and fifth forms allow access from any node with an IP
address of the form 6.7.8.x, 6.7.9.x, 6.7.10.x or 6.7.11.x (with x arbitrary),
i.e. the value 22 is the number of bits defining the specified subnet.  (In the
fifth form, the final byte is ignored).  The sixth form allows access by any
node on the entire Internet.

   <p>A second form of the directive, <code>allow all</code>, has a greater effect,
depending on the ordering of directives in the configuration file.  To
illustrate the effect, consider the two examples

<pre class="example">     allow 1.2.3.4
     deny 1.2.3
     allow 1.2
</pre>
   <p>and

<pre class="example">     allow 1.2.3.4
     deny 1.2.3
     allow all 1.2
</pre>
   <p>In the first example, the effect is the same regardles of what order the
three directives are given in.  So the 1.2.x.y subnet is allowed access,
except for the 1.2.3.x subnet, which is denied access, however the host
1.2.3.4 is allowed access.

   <p>In the second example, the <code>allow all 1.2</code> directives overrides the
effect of <em>any</em> previous directive relating to a subnet within the
specified subnet.  Within a configuration file this capability is
probably rather moot; however, it is of greater use for reconfiguration
at run-time via <code>chronyc</code> (see <a href="#allow-all-command">allow all command</a>).

   <p>Note, if the <code>initstepslew</code> directive (see <a href="#initstepslew-directive">initstepslew directive</a>) is used in the configuration file, each of the computers
listed in that directive must allow client access by this computer for
it to work.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.4 bindaddress</h4>

<p>The bindaddress allows you to restrict the network interface to which
chronyd will listen for NTP packets.  This provides an additional level of
access restriction above that available through the 'deny' mechanism.

   <p>Suppose you have a local ethernet with addresses in the 192.168.1.0
subnet together with a dial-up connection.  The ethernet interface's IP
address is 192.168.1.1.  Suppose (for some reason) you want to block all
access through the dialup connection (note, this will even block replies
from servers on the dialup side, so you will not be able to synchronise
to an external source).  You could add the line

<pre class="example">     bindaddress 192.168.1.1
</pre>
   <p>to the configuration file.

   <p>This directive affects NTP (UDP port 123) packets.  If no <code>bindcmdaddress</code>
directive is present, the address supplied by <code>bindaddress</code> will be used
to control binding of the command socket (UDP port 323) as well.

   <p>The <code>bindaddress</code> directive has been found to cause problems when used on
computers that need to pass NTP traffic over multiple network interfaces (e.g. 
firewalls).  It is, therefore, not particularly useful.  Use of the
<code>allow</code> and <code>deny</code> directives together with a network firewall is
more likely to be successful.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.5 bindcmdaddress</h4>

<p>The bindcmdaddress allows you to restrict the network interface to which
chronyd will listen for command packets (issued by chronyc).

   <p>Suppose you have a local ethernet with addresses in the 192.168.1.0 subnet
together with a dial-up connection.  The ethernet interface's IP address is
192.168.1.1.  Suppose you want to block all access through the dialup
connection.  You could add the line

   <p>The <code>bindcmdaddress</code> directive has been found to cause problems when used
on computers that need to pass command traffic over multiple network
interfaces.  It is, therefore, not particularly useful.  Use of the
<code>cmdallow</code> and <code>cmddeny</code> directives together with a network firewall
is more likely to be successful.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.6 broadcast</h4>

<p>The <code>broadcast</code> directive is used to declare a broadcast address to which
chronyd should send packets in NTP broadcast mode (i.e. make chronyd act as a
broadcast server).  Broadcast clients on that subnet will be able to
synchronise.

   <p>The syntax is as follows

<pre class="example">     broadcast 30 192.168.1.255
     broadcast 60 192.168.2.255 12123
</pre>
   <p>In the first example, the destination port defaults to 123/udp (the normal NTP
port).  In the second example, the destionation port is specified as 12123. 
The first parameter in each case (30 or 60 respectively) is the interval in
seconds between broadcast packets being sent.  The second parameter in each
case is the broadcast address to send the packet to.  This should correspond to
the broadcast address of one of the network interfaces on the computer where
chronyd is running.

   <p>You can have more than 1 <code>broadcast</code> directive if you have more than 1
network interface onto which you wish to send NTP broadcast packets.

   <p>Chronyd itself cannot currently act as a broadcast client; it must always be
configured as a point-to-point client by defining specific NTP servers and
peers.  This broadcast server feature is intended for providing a time source
to other NTP software (e.g. various MS Windows clients).

   <p>If xntpd is used as the broadcast client, it will try to use a point-to-point
client/server NTP access to measure the round-trip delay.  Thus, the broadcast
subnet should also be the subject of an <code>allow</code> directive (see <a href="#allow-directive">allow directive</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.12 driftfile</h4>

<p>One of the main activities of the <code>chronyd</code> program is to work out
the rate at which the system clock gains or loses time relative to real
time.

   <p>Whenever <code>chronyd</code> computes a new value of the gain/loss rate, it
is desirable to record it somewhere.  This allows <code>chronyd</code> to
begin compensating the system clock at that rate whenever it is
restarted, even before it has had a chance to obtain an equally good
estimate of the rate during the new run.  (This process may take many
minutes, at least).

   <p>The driftfile command allows a file to be specified into which
<code>chronyd</code> can store the rate information.  Two parameters are
recorded in the file.  The first is the rate at which the system clock
gains or loses time, expressed in parts per million, with gains
positive.  Therefore, a value of 100.0 indicates that when the system
clock has advanced by a second, it has gained 100 microseconds on
reality (so the true time has only advanced by 999900 microseconds). 
The second is an estimate of the error bound around the first value in
which the true rate actually lies.

   <p>An example of the driftfile command is

<pre class="example">     driftfile /etc/chrony.drift

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.13 dumpdir</h4>

<p>To compute the rate of gain or loss of time, <code>chronyd</code> has to store
a measurement history for each of the time sources it uses.

   <p>Certain systems (so far only Linux) have operating system support for
setting the rate of gain or loss to compensate for known errors.  (On
other systems, <code>chronyd</code> must simulate such a capability by
periodically slewing the system clock forwards or backwards by a
suitable amount to compensate for the error built up since the previous
slew).

   <p>For such systems, it is possible to save the measurement history across
restarts of <code>chronyd</code> (assuming no changes are made to the system
clock behaviour whilst it is not running).  If this capability is to be
used (via the dumponexit command in the configuration file, or the dump
command in chronyc), the dumpdir command should be used to define the
directory where the measurement histories are saved.

   <p>An example of the command is

<pre class="example">     dumpdir /var/log/chrony
</pre>
   <p>A source whose IP address is 1.2.3.4 would have its measurement
history saved in the file <samp><span class="file">/var/log/chrony/1.2.3.4.dat</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.15 initstepslew</h4>

<p>In normal operation, <code>chronyd</code> always slews the time when it needs to
adjust the system clock.  For example, to correct a system clock which
is 1 second slow, <code>chronyd</code> slightly increases the amount by which the
system clock is advanced on each clock interrupt, until the error is
removed.  (Actually, this is done by calling the <code>adjtime()</code> or
similar system function which does it for us.)  Note that at no time
does time run backwards with this method.

   <p>On most Unix systems it is not desirable to step the system clock,
because many programs rely on time advancing monotonically forwards.

   <p>When the <code>chronyd</code> daemon is initially started, it is possible that the
system clock is considerably in error.  Attempting to correct such an
error by slewing may not be sensible, since it may take several hours
to correct the error by this means.

   <p>The purpose of the <code>initstepslew</code> directive is to allow <code>chronyd</code> to
make a rapid measurement of the system clock error at boot time, and to
correct the system clock by stepping before normal operation begins. 
Since this would normally be performed only at an appropriate point in
the system boot sequence, no other software should be adversely affected
by the step.

   <p>If the correction required is less than a specified threshold, a slew is
used instead.  This makes it easier to restart <code>chronyd</code> whilst the
system is in normal operation.

   <p>The <code>initstepslew</code> directive takes a threshold and a list of NTP
servers as arguments.  A maximum of 8 will be used.  Each of the servers
is rapidly polled several times, and a majority voting mechanism used to
find the most likely range of system clock error that is present.  A
step (or slew) is applied to the system clock to correct this error. 
<code>chronyd</code> then enters its normal operating mode (where only slews are
used).

   <p>An example of use of the command is

<pre class="example">     initstepslew 30 foo.bar.com baz.quz.com
</pre>
   <p>where 2 NTP servers are used to make the measurement.  The <code>30</code>
indicates that if the system's error is found to be 30 seconds or less,
a slew will be used to correct it; if the error is above 30 seconds, a
step will be used.

   <p>The <code>initstepslew</code> directive can also be used in an isolated LAN
environment, where the clocks are set manually.  The most stable
computer is chosen as the master, and the other computers are slaved to
it.  If each of the slaves is configured with the local option (see
below), the master can be set up with an <code>initstepslew</code> directive
which references some or all of the slaves.  Then, if the master machine
has to be rebooted, the slaves can be relied on to 'flywheel' the time
for the master.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.17 local</h4>

<p>The local keyword is used to allow <code>chronyd</code> to appear synchronised
to real time (from the viewpoint of clients polling it), even if it has
no current synchronisation source.

   <p>This option is normally used on computers in an isolated network,
where several computers are required to synchronise to one other, this
being the "master" which is kept vaguely in line with real time by
manual input.

   <p>An example of the command is

<pre class="example">     local stratum 10
</pre>
   <p>The value 10 may be substituted with other values in the range 1
through 15.  Stratum 1 indicates a computer that has a true real-time
reference directly connected to it (e.g. GPS, atomic clock etc)
&amp;ndash; such computers are expected to be very close to real time. 
Stratum 2 computers are those which have a stratum 1 server; stratum 3
computers have a stratum 2 server and so on.

   <p>A large value of 10 indicates that the clock is so many hops away from
a reference clock that its time is fairly unreliable.  Put another
way, if the computer ever has access to another computer which is
ultimately synchronised to a reference clock, it will almost certainly
be at a stratum less than 10.  Therefore, the choice of a high value
like 10 for the local command prevents the machine's own time from
ever being confused with real time, were it ever to leak out to
clients that have visibility of real servers.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.25 maxupdateskew</h4>

<p>One of <code>chronyd's</code> tasks is to work out how fast or slow the computer's
clock runs relative to its reference sources.  In addition, it computes
an estimate of the error bounds around the estimated value.

   <p>If the range of error is too large, it probably indicates that the
measurements have not settled down yet, and that the estimated gain or
loss rate is not very reliable.

   <p>The <code>maxupdateskew</code> parameter allows the threshold for determining
whether an estimate may be so unreliable that it should not be used.

   <p>The syntax is

<pre class="example">     maxupdateskew &lt;skew-in-ppm&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Typical values for &lt;skew-in-ppm&gt; might be 100 for a dial-up connection
to servers over a phone line, and 5 or 10 for a computer on a LAN.

   <p>It should be noted that this is not the only means of protection against
using unreliable estimates.  At all times, <code>chronyd</code> keeps track of
both the estimated gain or loss rate, and the error bound on the
estimate.  When a new estimate is generated following another
measurement from one of the sources, a weighted combination algorithm is
used to update the master estimate.  So if <code>chronyd</code> has an existing
highly-reliable master estimate and a new estimate is generated which
has large error bounds, the existing master estimate will dominate in
the new master estimate.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.31 rtcfile</h4>

<p>The <code>rtcfile</code> directive defines the name of the file in which
<code>chronyd</code> can save parameters associated with tracking the accuracy
of the system's real-time clock (RTC).

   <p>The syntax is illustrated in the following example

<pre class="example">     rtcfile /etc/chrony.rtc
</pre>
   <p><code>chronyd</code> saves information in this file when it exits and when the
<code>writertc</code> command is issued in <code>chronyc</code>.  The information
saved is the RTC's error at some epoch, that epoch (in seconds since
January 1 1970), and the rate at which the RTC gains or loses time.

   <p>So far, the support for real-time clocks is limited - their code is even
more system-specific than the rest of the software.  You can only use
the real time clock facilities (the <code>rtcfile</code> directive and the
<code>-s</code> command line option to <code>chronyd</code>) if the following three
conditions apply:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>You are running Linux version 2.2.x or 2.4.x (for any value of x), or v2.0.x
with x&gt;=32.

     <li>You have compiled the kernel with extended real-time clock support
(i.e. the <samp><span class="file">/dev/rtc</span></samp> device is capable of doing useful things).

     <li>You don't have other applications that need to make use of
<samp><span class="file">/dev/rtc</span></samp> at all.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.32 rtconutc</h4>

<p><code>chronyd</code> assumes by default that the real time clock (RTC) keeps
local time (including any daylight saving changes).  This is convenient
on PCs running Linux which are dual-booted with DOS or Windows.

   <p>NOTE : IF YOU KEEP THE REAL TIME CLOCK ON LOCAL TIME AND YOUR COMPUTER
IS OFF WHEN DAYLIGHT SAVING (SUMMER TIME) STARTS OR ENDS, THE COMPUTER'S
SYSTEM TIME WILL BE ONE HOUR IN ERROR WHEN YOU NEXT BOOT AND START
CHRONYD.

   <p>An alternative is for the RTC to keep Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). 
This does not suffer from the 1 hour problem when daylight saving starts
or ends.

   <p>If the <code>rtconutc</code> directive appears, it means the RTC is required
to keep UTC.  The directive takes no arguments.  It is equivalent to
specifying the <code>-u</code> switch to the Linux <samp><span class="file">/sbin/clock</span></samp> program.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.33 server</h4>

<p>The <code>server</code> directive allows NTP servers to be specified.  The
client/server relationship is strictly hierarchical : a client may
synchronise its system time to that of the server, but the server's
system time will never be influenced by that of a client.

   <p>The <code>server</code> directive is immediately followed by either the name
of the server, or its IP address in dotted-quad notation.  The server
command also supports a number of subfields (which may be defined in any
order):

     <dl>
<dt><code>port</code><dd>This option allows the UDP port on which the server understands NTP
requests to be specified.  For normal servers this option should not be
required (the default is 123, the standard NTP port). 
<br><dt><code>minpoll</code><dd>Although <code>chronyd</code> will trim the rate at which it samples the
server during normal operation, the user may wish to constrain the
minimum polling interval.  This is always defined as a power of 2, so
&lt;tt/minpoll 5/ would mean that the polling interval cannot drop below 32
seconds.  The default is 6 (64 seconds). 
<br><dt><code>maxpoll</code><dd>In a similar way, the user may wish to constrain the maximum polling
interval.  Again this is specified as a power of 2, so &lt;tt/maxpoll 9/
indicates that the polling interval must stay at or below 512 seconds. 
The default is 10 (1024 seconds). 
<br><dt><code>maxdelay</code><dd><code>chronyd</code> uses the network round-trip delay to the server to
determine how accurate a particular measurement is likely to be.  Long
round-trip delays indicate that the request, or the response, or both
were delayed.  If only one of the messages was delayed the measurement
error is likely to be substantial.

     <p>For small variations in round trip delay, <code>chronyd</code> uses a
weighting scheme when processing the measurements.  However, beyond a
certain level of delay the measurements are likely to be so corrupted as
to be useless.  (This is particularly so on dial-up or other slow links,
where a long delay probably indicates a highly asymmetric delay caused
by the response waiting behind a lot of packets related to a download of
some sort).

     <p>If the user knows that round trip delays above a certain level should
cause the measurement to be ignored, this level can be defined with the
maxdelay command.  For example, &lt;tt/maxdelay 0.3/ would indicate that
measurements with a round-trip delay of 0.3 seconds or more should be
ignored.

     <br><dt><code>maxdelayratio</code><dd>This option is similar to the maxdelay option above.  <code>chronyd</code>
keeps a record of the minimum round-trip delay amongst the previous
measurements that it has buffered.  If a measurement has a round trip
delay that is greater than the maxdelayratio times the minimum delay, it
will be rejected.

     <br><dt><code>presend</code><dd>If the timing measurements being made by <code>chronyd</code> are the only
network data passing between two computers, you may find that some
measurements are badly skewed due to either the client or the server
having to do an ARP lookup on the other party prior to transmitting a
packet.  This is more of a problem with long sampling intervals, which
may be similar in duration to the lifetime of entries in the ARP caches
of the machines.

     <p>In order to avoid this problem, the <code>presend</code> option may be used. 
It takes a single integer argument, which is the smallest polling
interval for which a pair of packets will be exchanged between the
client and the server prior to the actual measurement being initiated by
the client.  For example, with the following option included in a
<code>server</code> directive :

     <pre class="example">          presend 9
</pre>
     <p>when the polling interval is 512 seconds or more, a UDP echo datagram
will be sent to the server a short time (currently 4 seconds) before the
NTP client mode datagram.

     <br><dt><code>key</code><dd>The NTP protocol supports the inclusion of checksums in the packets, to
prevent computers having their system time upset by rogue packets being
sent to them.  The checksums are generated as a function of a password,
using the MD5 algorithm.

     <p>The association between key numbers and passwords is contained in the
keys file, defined by the keyfile command.

     <p>If the key option is present, <code>chronyd</code> will attempt to use
authenticated packets when communicating with this server.  The key
number used will be the single argument to the key option.  The server
must have the same password for this key number configured, otherwise no
relationship between the computers will be possible.

     <br><dt><code>offline</code><dd>If the server will not be reachable when <code>chronyd</code> is started, the
offline option may be specified.  <code>chronyd</code> will not try to poll
the server until it is enabled to do so (by using the online option of
<code>chronyc</code>).

     <br><dt><code>auto_offline</code><dd>If this option is set, the server will be assumed to have gone offline when 2
requests have been sent to it without receiving a response.  This option avoids
the need to run the <code>offline</code> (see <a href="#offline-command">offline command</a>) command from
chrony when disconnecting the dial-up link.  (It will still be necessary to use
chronyc's <code>online</code> (see <a href="#online-command">online command</a>) command when the link has been
established, to enable measurements to start.)

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.3 Security with chronyc</h4>

<p>Many of the commands available through chronyc have a fair amount of
power to reconfigure the run-time behaviour of <code>chronyd</code>.  Consequently,
<code>chronyc</code> is quite dangerous for the integrity of the target
system's clock performance.  Having access to <code>chronyd</code> via chronyc is
more or less equivalent to being able to modify <code>chronyd's</code> configuration
file (typically <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.conf</span></samp>) and to restart <code>chronyd</code>.

   <p>Chronyc also provides a number of monitoring (as opposed to commanding)
commands, which will not affect the behaviour of <code>chronyd</code>.  However, you
may still want to restrict access to these commands.

   <p>In view of this, access to some of the capabilities of chronyc will
usually be tightly controlled.  There are two mechanisms supported:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The set of hosts from which <code>chronyd</code> will accept commands can be
restricted.  By default, commands will only be accepted from the same
host that <code>chronyd</code> is running on. 
<li>Any command that actually reconfigures some aspect of <code>chronyd's</code>
behaviour requires the user of chronyc to know a password.  This
password is specified in <code>chronyd's</code> keys file (see <a href="#keyfile-directive">keyfile directive</a>)
and specified via the commandkey option in its configuration file
(see <a href="#commandkey-directive">commandkey directive</a>).
        </ol>

   <p>Only the following commands can be used <em>without</em> providing a
password:

     <ul>
<li><code>exit</code>
<li><code>help</code>
<li><code>password</code>
<li><code>quit</code>
<li><code>rtcdata</code>
<li><code>sources</code>
<li><code>sourcestats</code>
<li><code>tracking</code>
</ul>

   <p>All other commands require a password to have been specified previously,
because they affect <code>chronyd's</code> operation.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.3.4.7 burst</h5>

<p>The <code>burst</code> command tells <code>chronyd</code> to make a set of measurements to
each of its sources over a short duration (rather than the usual
periodic measurements that it makes).  After such a burst, <code>chronyd</code> will
revert to the previous state for each source.  This might be either
online, if the source was being periodically measured in the normal way,
or offline, if the source had been indicated as being offline. 
(Switching a source between the online and offline states is described
in <a href="#online-command">online command</a>, <a href="#offline-command">offline command</a>).

   <p>The syntax of the burst command is as follows

<pre class="example">     burst &lt;n-good-measurements&gt;/&lt;max-measurements&gt; [&lt;mask&gt;/&lt;masked-address&gt;]
</pre>
   <p>The mask and masked-address arguments are optional, in which case
<code>chronyd</code> will initiate a burst for all of its currently defined sources.

   <p>The arguments have the following meaning and format.

     <dl>
<dt><code>n-good-measurements</code><dd>This defines the number of good measurements that <code>chronyd</code> will want to
obtain from each source.  A measurement is good if it passes certain
tests, for example, the round trip time to the source must be
acceptable.  (This allows <code>chronyd</code> to reject measurements that are likely
to be bogus.)

     <br><dt><code>max-measurements</code><dd>This defines the maximum number of measurements that <code>chronyd</code> will
attempt to make, even if the required number of good measurements has
not been obtained.

     <br><dt><code>mask</code><dd>This is a dotted quad argument (e.g. <code>255.255.255.0</code>) with which
the IP address of each of <code>chronyd</code>'s sources is to be masked.

     <br><dt><code>masked-address</code><dd>This is a dotted quad argument (e.g. <code>1.2.3.0</code>).  If the masked IP
address of a source matches this value then the burst command is applied
to that source. 
</dl>

   <p>If no mask or masked address arguments are provided, the default is
<code>0.0.0.0</code> and <code>0.0.0.0</code> respectively, which will match every
source.

   <p>An example of the two-argument form of the command is

<pre class="example">     burst 2/10
</pre>
   <p>This will cause <code>chronyd</code> to attempt to get two good measurements from
each source, stopping after two have been obtained, but in no event will
it try more than ten probes to the source.

   <p>An example of the four-argument form of the command is

<pre class="example">     burst 2/10 255.255.0.0/1.2.0.0
</pre>
   <p>In this case, the two out of ten sampling will only be applied to
sources whose IP addresses are of the form <code>1.2.x.y</code>, where x and y
are arbitrary.

the host access checks (set with the <code>allow</code>, <code>deny</code>,
<code>cmdallow</code> and <code>cmddeny</code> commands or configuration file

<li>The hostname of the client
<li>The number of times the client has accessed the server using an NTP
client mode packet. 
<li>The number of times the client has accessed the server using an NTP

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.3.4.22 makestep</h5>

<p>Normally chronyd will cause the system to gradually correct any time
offset, by slowing down or speeding up the clock as required.  In
certain situations, the system clock may be so far adrift that this
slewing process would take a very long time to correct the system clock.

   <p>The <code>makestep</code> command can be used in this situation.  It cancels
any remaining correction that was being slewed, and jumps the system
clock by the equivalent amount, making it correct immediately.

   <p>BE WARNED - certain software will be seriously affected by such jumps to
the system time.  (That is the reason why chronyd uses slewing
normally.)

   <p>The <code>on</code> form of the command enables use of the <code>settime</code>
command.

   <p>The <code>off</code> form of the command disables use of the <code>settime</code>

   <p>The <code>list</code> form of the command lists all the samples currently
stored in <code>chronyd</code>.  The output is illustrated below.

<pre class="example">     210 n_samples = 1

   <p>The columns as as follows :

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The sample index (used for the <code>manual delete</code> command)
<li>The date and time of the sample
<li>The system clock error when the timestamp was entered, adjusted to allow
for changes made to the system clock since. 
<li>The system clock error when the timestamp was entered, as it originally
was (without allowing for changes to the system clock since). 
<li>The regression residual at this point, in seconds.  This allows
'outliers' to be easily spotted, so that they can be deleted using the
<code>manual delete</code> command.
        </ol>

   <p>The <code>delete</code> form of the command deletes a single sample.  The
parameter is the index of the sample, as shown in the first column of
the output from <code>manual list</code>.  Following deletion of the data
point, the current error and drift rate are re-estimated from the
remaining data points and the system clock trimmed if necessary.  This
option is intended to allow 'outliers' to be discarded, i.e. samples
where the administrator realises he/she has entered a very poor
timestamp.

   <p>The <code>reset</code> form of the command deletes all samples at once.  The
system clock is left running as it was before the command was entered.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.3.4.29 offline</h5>

<p>The <code>offline</code> command is used to warn <code>chronyd</code> that the network
connection to a particular host or hosts is about to be lost.  It should
be used on computers with a dial-up or similar connection to their time
sources, to warn <code>chronyd</code> that the connection is about to be broken.

   <p>An example of how to use <code>offline</code> in this case is shown in
<a href="#Advising-chronyd-of-internet-availability">Advising chronyd of internet availability</a>.

   <p>Another case where <code>offline</code> could be used is where a computer
serves time to a local group of computers, and has a permanant
connection to true time servers outside the organisation.  However, the
external connection is heavily loaded at certain times of the day and
the measurements obtained are less reliable at those times.  In this
case, it is probably most useful to determine the gain/loss rate during
the quiet periods and let the whole network coast through the loaded
periods.  The <code>offline</code> and <code>online</code> commands can be used to
achieve this.  The situation is shown in the figure below.

<pre class="example">               +----------+
               |Ext source|
               +----------+
                   |

                   |/| &lt;-- Link with variable

       |   |   |     |     |    |    |
                Local clients
</pre>
   <p>If the source to which <code>chronyd</code> is currently synchronised is indicated
offline in this way, <code>chronyd</code> will continue to treat it as the
synchronisation source.  If the network connection were broken without
the <code>offline</code> command being used, <code>chronyd</code> would assume that the
source had failed and would attempt to pick another synchronisation
source.

   <p>There are two forms of the <code>offline</code> command.  The first form is a
wildcard, meaning all sources.  The second form allows a IP address mask
and a masked address to be specified.  These forms are illustrated below.

<pre class="example">     offline
     offline 255.255.255.0/1.2.3.0
</pre>
   <p>The second form means that the <code>offline</code> command is to be applied
to any source whose IP address is in the 1.2.3 subnet.  (The host's
address is logically and-ed with the mask, and if the result matches the
masked-address the host is processed).

   <p>The wildcard form of the address is actually equivalent to

<pre class="example">     offline 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0

     Number of samples  : 10

     Sample span period :  549
     RTC is fast by     :    -1.632736 seconds
     RTC gains time at  :  -107.623 ppm
</pre>
   <p>The fields have the following meaning

     <dl>
<dt><code>RTC ref time (GMT)</code><dd>This is the RTC reading the last time its error was measured. 
<br><dt><code>Number of samples</code><dd>This is the number of previous measurements being used to determine the
RTC gain/loss rate. 
<br><dt><code>Number of runs</code><dd>This is the number of runs of residuals of the same sign following the
regression fit for (RTC error) versus (RTC time).  A value which is
small indicates that the measurements are not well approximated by a
linear model, and that the algorithm will tend to delete the older
measurements to improve the fit. 
<br><dt><code>Sample span period</code><dd>This is the period that the measurements span (from the oldest to the
newest).  Without a unit the value is in seconds; suffixes `m' for
minutes, `h' for hours, `d' for days or `y' for years may be used. 
<br><dt><code>RTC is fast by</code><dd>This is the estimate of how many seconds fast the RTC when it thought
the time was at the reference time (above).  If this value is large, you
may (or may not) want to use the <code>trimrtc</code> command to bring the RTC
into line with the system clock.  (Note, a large error will not affect
<code>chronyd's</code> operation, unless it becomes so big as to start causing
rounding errors. 
<br><dt><code>RTC gains time at</code><dd>This is the amount of time gained (positive) or lost (negative) by the
real time clock for each second that it ticks.  It is measured in parts
per million.  So if the value shown was +1, suppose the RTC was exactly
right when it crosses a particular second boundary.  Then it would be 1
microsecond fast when it crosses its next second boundary.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.3.4.34 settime</h5>

<p>The <code>settime</code> command allows the current time to be entered
manually, if this option has been configured into <code>chronyd</code>.  (It may be
configured either with the <code>manual</code> directive in the configuration
file (see <a href="#manual-directive">manual directive</a>), or with the <code>manual</code> command of
chronyc (see <a href="#manual-command">manual command</a>).

   <p>It should be noted that the computer's sense of time will only be as
accurate as the reference you use for providing this input (e.g. your
watch), as well as how well you can time the press of the return key. 
When inputting time to an isolated network, I have a battery operated
alarm clock that is synchronised to the Rugby MSF time signal in the UK.

   <p>Providing your computer's time zone is set up properly, you will be able
to enter a local time (rather than UTC).

   <p>The response to a successful <code>settime</code> command indicates the amount
that the computer's clock was wrong.  It should be apparent from this if
you have entered the time wrongly, e.g. with the wrong time zone.

   <p>The rate of drift of the system clock is estimated by a regression
process using the entered measurement and all previous measurements
entered during the present run of <code>chronyd</code>.  However, the entered
measurement is used for adjusting the current clock offset (rather than
the estimated intercept from the regression, which is ignored). 
Contrast what happens with the <code>manual delete</code> command, where the
intercept is used to set the current offset (since there is no
measurement that has just been typed in in that case).

   <p>The time is parsed by the public domain <samp><span class="file">getdate</span></samp> algorithm. 
Consequently, you can only specify time to the nearest second.

   <p>Examples of inputs that are valid are shown below.

     settime 16:30:05

shown at start-up, until at least 3 samples have been gathered from it.

     <br><dt><code>Name/IP address</code><dd>This shows the name or the IP address of the source.

     <br><dt><code>Stratum</code><dd>This shows the stratum of the source, as reported in its most recently
received sample.  Stratum 1 indicates a computer with a locally attached
reference clock.  A computer that is synchronised to a stratum 1
computer is at stratum 2.  A computer that is synchronised to a stratum
2 computer is at stratum 3, and so on.

     <br><dt><code>Poll</code><dd>This shows the rate at which the source is being polled, as a base-2
logarithm of the interval in seconds.  Thus, a value of 6 would indicate
that a measurement is being made every 64 seconds.

     <p><code>chronyd</code> automatically varies the polling rate in response to prevailing
conditions.

     <br><dt><code>LastRx</code><dd>This column shows how long ago the last sample was received from the
source.  This is normally in seconds.  The letters <code>m</code>, <code>h</code>,
<code>d</code> or <code>y</code> indicate minutes, hours, days or years.

     <br><dt><code>Last sample</code><dd>This column shows the offset between the local clock and the source at
the last measurement.  The number in the square brackets shows the
actual measured offset.  This may be suffixed by <code>us</code> (indicating
microseconds), <code>ms</code> (indicating milliseconds), or <code>s</code>
(indicating seconds).  The number to the left of the square brackets
shows the original measurement, adjusted to allow for any slews applied
to the local clock since.  The number following the <code>+/-</code> indicator
shows the margin of error in the measurement.

<p>The <code>tracking</code> command displays parameters about the system's clock
performance.  An example of the output is shown below.

<pre class="example">     Reference ID    : 1.2.3.4 (a.b.c)
     Stratum         : 3
     Ref time (UTC)  : Sun May 17 06:13:11 1998
     System time     : 0.000000 seconds fast of NTP time
     Frequency       : 331.898 ppm fast
     Residual freq   : 0.004 ppm
     Skew            : 0.154 ppm
     Root delay      : 0.373169 seconds
     Root dispersion : 0.024780 seconds
</pre>
   <p>The fields are explained as follows.

     <dl>
<dt><code>Reference ID</code><dd>This is the IP address, and name if available, of the server to which
the computer is currently synchronised.  If this is <code>127.127.1.1</code>
it means the computer is not synchronised to any external source and
that you have the `local' mode operating (via the <code>local</code> command
in <code>chronyc</code> (see <a href="#local-command">local command</a>), or the <code>local</code> directive
in the <samp><span class="file">/etc/chrony.conf</span></samp> file (see <a href="#local-directive">local directive</a>)).

     <br><dt><code>Stratum</code><dd>The stratum indicates how many hops away from a computer with an
attached reference clock we are.  Such a computer is a stratum-1
computer, so the computer in the example is two hops away
(i.e. <code>a.b.c</code> is a stratum-2 and is synchronised from a stratum-1).

     <br><dt><code>Ref time</code><dd>This is the time (GMT) at which the last measurement from the reference
source was processed.

     <br><dt><code>System time</code><dd>In normal operation, <code>chronyd</code> <em>never</em> steps the system clock,
because any jump in the timescale can have adverse consequences for
certain application programs.  Instead, any error in the system clock is
corrected by slightly speeding up or slowing down the system clock until
the error has been removed, and then returning to the system clock's
normal speed.  A consequence of this is that there will be a period when
the system clock (as read by other programs using the
<code>gettimeofday()</code> system call, or by the <code>date</code> command in the
shell) will be different from <code>chronyd's</code> estimate of the current
true time (which it reports to NTP clients when it is operating in
server mode).  The value reported on this line is the difference due to
this effect.

     <p>On systems such as Solaris and SunOS, <code>chronyd</code> has no means to
adjust the fundamental rate of the system clock, so keeps the system
time correct by periodically making offsets to it as though an error had
been measured.  The build up of these offsets will be observed in this
report.  On systems such as Linux where <code>chronyd</code> can adjust the
fundamental rate of the system clock, this value will show zero unless a
very recent measurement has shown the system to be error.

     <br><dt><code>Frequency</code><dd>The `frequency' is the rate by which the system's clock would be would
be wrong if <code>chronyd</code> was not correcting it.  It is expressed in
ppm (parts per million).  For example, a value of 1ppm would mean that
when the system's clock thinks it has advanced 1 second, it has actually
advanced by 1.000001 seconds relative to true time.

     <p>As you can see in the example, the clock in the computer I developed
<code>chrony</code> on is not a very good one - it gains about 30 seconds per
day!  This was the reason I started to write <code>chrony</code> in the first
place.

     <br><dt><code>Residual freq</code><dd>This shows the `residual frequency' for the currently selected reference
source.  This reflects any difference between what the measurements from
the reference source indicate the frequency should be and the frequency
currently being used.

     <p>The reason this is not always zero is that a smoothing procedure is
applied to the frequency.  Each time a measurement from the reference
source is obtained and a new residual frequency computed, the estimated
accuracy of this residual is compared with the estimated accuracy (see
`skew' next) of the existing frequency value.  A weighted average is
computed for the new frequency, with weights depending on these
accuracies.  If the measurements from the reference source follow a
consistent trend, the residual will be driven to zero over time.

     <br><dt><code>Skew</code><dd>This is the estimated error bound on the the frequency.

     <br><dt><code>Root delay</code><dd>This is the total of the network path delays to the stratum-1 computer
from which the computer is ultimately synchronised.

     <p>In certain extreme situations, this value can be negative.  (This can
arise in a symmetric peer arrangement where the computers' frequencies
are not tracking each other and the network delay is very short relative
to the turn-around time at each computer.)

     <br><dt><code>Root dispersion</code><dd>This is the total dispersion accumulated through all the computers back
to the stratum-1 computer from which the computer is ultimately
synchronised.  Dispersion is due to system clock resolution, statistical
measurement variations etc.

     <p>An absolute bound on the computer's clock accuracy (assuming the
stratum-1 computer is correct) is given by

     <pre class="example">          clock_error &lt;= root_dispersion + (0.5 * |root_delay|)

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.3.4.38 trimrtc</h5>

<p>The <code>trimrtc</code> command is used to correct the system's real time
clock (RTC) to the main system clock.  It has no effect if the error
between the two clocks is currently estimated at less than a second (the
resolution of the RTC is only 1 second).

   <p>The command takes no arguments.  It performs the following steps (if the
RTC is more than 1 second away from the system clock):

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Remember the currently estimated gain/loss rate of the RTC and flush the
previous measurements. 
<li>Step the real time clock to bring it within a second of the system clock. 
<li>Make several measurements to accurately determine the new offset between
the RTC and the system clock (i.e. the remaining fraction of a second
error)
<li>Save the RTC parameters to the RTC file (specified with the
<code>rtcfile</code> directive in the configuration file (see <a href="#rtcfile-directive">rtcfile directive</a>).
        </ol>

   <p>The last step is done as a precaution against the computer suffering a
power failure before either the daemon exits or the <code>writertc</code>
command is issued.

   <p><code>chronyd</code> will still work perfectly well both whilst operating and
across machine reboots even if the <code>trimrtc</code> command is never used
(and the RTC is allowed to drift away from true time).  The
<code>trimrtc</code> command is provided as a method by which it can be
corrected, in a manner compatible with <code>chronyd</code> using it to
maintain accurate time across machine reboots.

<li>In order to avoid floating point arithmetic, the kernel uses shifting
and adding to approximate a scaling of 100/128.  This approximation
implies that the frequency set via the <code>adjtimex()</code> system call is
not the frequency that is actually obtained.  The method of
approximation varies between kernel versions and must be determined by
examining the kernel source.  An inverse factor must be included in the
driver to compensate. 
<li>In some kernel versions, an <code>adjtimex()</code> system call with the flags
bits all zeroed will return the amount of offset still to be corrected. 
In others (e.g. the 2.0 series beyond 2.0.32), the offset must be
changed in order to get the old offset returned (similar to
<code>adjtime()</code> on other systems).

<div align="center">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div align="center">Version 2, June 1991</div>

   <p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   <p>			    Preamble

   <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software&ndash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

   <p>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   <p>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

   <p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

   <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   <p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   <p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   <p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

   <p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

   <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

   <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

   <p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   <p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   <p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

   <p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

   <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

   <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

   <p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

   <p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

   <p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

   <p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

   <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

   <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

   <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   <p>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   <p>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

   <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

   <p>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   <p>			    NO WARRANTY

   <p>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   <p>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   <p>		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   <p>	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

   <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

   <p>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;

   <p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

   <p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

   <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA

   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

   <p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items&ndash;whatever suits your program.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

   <p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

   <p>&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

   <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
