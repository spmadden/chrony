# This is an example chrony keys file.  It enables authentication of NTP
# packets with symmetric keys when its location is specified by the keyfile
# directive in chrony.conf(5).  It should be readable only by root and the
# user under which chronyd is running.
#
# Don't use the example keys!  It's recommended to generate random keys using
# the chronyc keygen command.

# Examples of valid keys:

#1 MD5 AVeryLongAndRandomPassword
#2 MD5 HEX:12114855C7931009B4049EF3EFC48A139C3F989F
#3 SHA1 HEX:B2159C05D6A219673A3B7E896B6DE07F6A440995
#4 AES128 HEX:2DA837C4B6573748CA692B8C828E4891
#5 AES256 HEX:2666B8099BFF2D5BA20876121788ED24D2BE59111B8FFB562F0F56AE6EC7246E
