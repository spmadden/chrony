Description: Sets your computer's clock from time servers on the Net
 It consists of a pair of programs :
 `chronyd'.  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.  It
 obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems, and adjusts the system time accordingly.  For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by hand
 (using `chronyc').  In either case, `chronyd' determines the rate at which
 the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.  Chronyd
 implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or a server.
 `chronyc'.  This is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within the
 daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running.
