chrony (1.23-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Commented out rtcfile directive in chrony.conf because it can cause
    lockups with certain combinations of motherboard and kernel (this is
    a known kernel bug).

    Closes: #508298: chronyd unreachable and does not work (clock drifts)
  
  * Chrony no longer uses the ppp/ip-up.d and ppp/ip-up.d files and the new
    init.d file won't hang if chronyc hangs.
  
    Closes: #448481: /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony doesn't work when bindaddress is set.

chrony (1.23-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dependency of init script on Pppconfig ip-up.d script by moving
    those lines into the init script.
  
  * Added checks to try to make sure that Chronyd is really, really running.
    Changed Netstat call to use -n, added code to kill it if it hangs.
    Added code to kill Chronyc if it can't contact Chronyd.
    Discussed the HPET/rtc problem in NEWS.Debian.
  
    Closes: #504000: init script hangs for a while might break upgrade

  * Added missing initialization to create_instance() in ntp_core.c.
    This was why UTI_NormaliseTimeval() was being called with huge
    values at times.

  * See comment on #195620 in 1.21z-6 below.  If you know of more LP64
    bugs reopen #348412 with a patch.
  
    Closes: #348412: chronyc not LP64 compliant
  
  * Added comment about sources being discarded to chrony.conf as suggested
    by Andreas HÃ¼bner in  #268289.
  
  * This is normal behavior.

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Thu, 06 Nov 2008 10:38:58 -0600

chrony (1.23-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rewrote UTI_NormaliseTimeval()in util.c to use divide/remainder
    instead of loops at the suggestion of Gabor Gombas.  This prevents the
    problem of the loop running until the sun goes out when the function
    is called with a very large value for tv_usec on 64-bit architectures.
    Also fixed some other spots where the same loop was being used.
  
    Closes: #474294 Goes into endless loop
    Closes: #447011 chronyd stalls with 100% CPU usage
     
    I still don't know why the function is being called with such a 
    large value, however.

  * Changed default servers in chrony,conf to Debian servers.
  
    Closes: #434483: chrony: Should use NTP servers in Debian pool

chrony (1.21z-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches from Eric Lammerts <eric@lammerts.org> and Goswin von
    Brederlow <brederlo@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de> to cast the value
    returned by ntohl to int32_t and so cause correct sign-extension near
    line 1655 in client.c.  Also fixed similar bugs in the same area.  I'm
    not sure this entirely fixes the chronyc number display problem,
    though.  I've not closed #348412 here because chrony is still not
    fully LP64 compliant.
    Closes: #195620: Strange "System time : xxx seconds slow of
    NTP time" output

  * Replaced addrfilt.c with addrfilt.c from upstream git repository.
    This fixes the recursive structure definition problems.

  * Replaced 'route' with 'netstat -r' in the initscript.

  * Applied patch for configure script from Nathanael Nerode
    <neroden@gcc.gnu.org> to delete the superfluous "lncurses" at line
    327.
    Closes: #392273: Recursive dependency disease: chrony shouldn't depend
    on ncurses

  * Added test to reject servers claiming stratum less than 1 in
    ntp_core.c "Test 7".  Bill Unruh <unruh@physics.ubc.ca> has run across
    a server that sometimes claims to be stratum 0, which causes
    considerable confusion.

  * Applied postinst patch from Lionel Elie Mamane to test for the

    Closes: #397759: fails to configure: mv: cannot stat `/etc/chrony/chrony.keys.1.21-2':
    No such file or directory

  * Added burst command to /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony to give chronyd a kick in the butt.
    Shouldn't need that, though.
    Initscript now calls /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony if a default route exists.

  * Corrected erroneous use of 'dpkg --compare-version' in preinst and postinst.
    Closes: #386733: fails to configure (bad upgrade check)

  * Added rm to postinst to remove keyfile possibly left by a failed install.
    Closes: #390278: usage of tempfile /etc/chrony/chrony.keys is doubtful

    I consider this bug serious because it can cause installation to fail
    and so I want to get the fix into Sarge.
  
  * Fixed typo in chrony.conf, replaced '/etc/init.d/chrony restart'
    with 'invoke-rc.d chrony restart'.

  * Corrected "See Also" section in chrony man page.  Now mentions
    chronyc(1), chronyd(8), and chrony.conf(5).
    Closes: #287444: chrony.1.gz: SEE ALSO on man page has wrong section.
  
  * Edited chrony.conf to disable rtc by default and explain why:
    on some systems that use genrtc or the HPET real-time clock it
    fails and causes chronyd to fill up the log.  The failure is
    probably due to a kernel bug, bug the logging should be
    throttled.
  
  * Added more explanatory comments at the servers directive in 
    chrony.conf.
  
  * The postinst script now sends a message to root saying where the
    password is, whether Chrony is assuming UTC or local time,
    that rtc updating is disabled, why, and how to change it.
  
  * Added missing '#' to
    "Can't tell how your clock is set: assuming local time."
    in postinst.
