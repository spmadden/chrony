    - Set -x as default if unable to set time (e.g. in containers) (LP 1589780)
      Chrony is a single service which acts as both NTP client (i.e. syncing the
      local clock) and NTP server (i.e. providing NTP services to the network),
      and that is both desired and expected in the vast majority of cases.
      But in containers syncing the local clock is usually impossible, but this
      shall not break the providing of NTP services to the network.
      To some extent this makes chrony's default config more similar to 'ntpd',
      which complained in syslog but still provided NTP server service in those
      cases.
      + debian/chrony.service: allow the service to run without CAP_SYS_TIME
      + debian/control: add new dependency libcap2-bin for capsh (usually
        installed anyway, but make them explicit to be sure).
      + debian/chrony.default: new option SYNC_IN_CONTAINER to not fall back
        (Default off) [fixed a minor typo in the comment in this update]
      + debian/chronyd-starter.sh: wrapper to handle special cases in containers
        and if CAP_SYS_TIME is missing. Effectively allows to run NTP server in
        containers on a default installation and avoid failing to sync time (or
        if allowed to sync, avoid multiple containers to fight over it by
        accident).
      + debian/install: make chrony-starter.sh available on install.

  * debian/chrony.service:
    - Don’t conflict with systemd-timesyncd.service.
    A few users complain that chronyd does not start at boot. The way the
    Conflict= directive works internally might cause both systemd-timesyncd
    and chronyd to be inactive at boot. So by relying solely on the
    disable-with-time-daemon.conf drop-in file provided by systemd, we should
    get rid of this malfunction while still preventing these two time daemons
    from being active at the same time. Kudos notably go to Santiago Vila for
    the report and providing SSH access to a GCE instance where the issue was
    reproducible and Michael Biebl for debugging. (Closes: #947936)

  * debian/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 4.5.0 (no changes required).
    - No need to explicitly conflict with ntp as it now provides time-daemon.

  * debian/copyright:
    - Update copyright year for debian/*.

  * debian/patches/:

    glibc 2.31 switched the adjtimex() function to the clock_adjtime
    system call.

    - Update clknetsim version. This new version supports glibc >= 2.31 headers.

    - Add myself as a copyright holder for 2019.

  * debian/links:
    - Now that “networkd-dispatcher” is in the Debian archive, link
    NetworkManager dispatcher script to networkd-dispatcher routable and off
    states. Patch cherry-picked from Ubuntu; thanks to Christian Ehrhardt
    <christian.ehrhardt@canonical.com> for working on this.

  * debian/NEWS:
    - Report that a system call filter is now enabled by default and the way
    to disable it if needed.

  * debian/rules:
    - Don’t enable the system call filter on some architectures due to missing
    support in the “libseccomp” and/or the Linux kernel.

  * debian/upstream/:
    - Strip upstream key from extra signatures. Thanks lintian!
    - Remove the Miroslav-Lichvar.txt file as it serves no purpose.

  * debian/usr.sbin.chronyd:
    - Don’t include “tunables/sys”. The etc/apparmor.d/tunables/sys file has
    been deprecated in AppArmor 2.13.1! The @{sys} variable is now defined in
    “tunables/kernelvars” which is included in “tunables/global”.

chrony (3.4-1ubuntu1) disco; urgency=medium

  * Merge with Debian unstable (LP: #1802886). Remaining changes:
    - d/chrony.conf: use ubuntu ntp pool and server (LP 1744664)
    - Set -x as default if unable to set time (e.g. in containers) (LP: 1589780)
      Chrony is a single service which acts as both NTP client (i.e. syncing the
      local clock) and NTP server (i.e. providing NTP services to the network),
      and that is both desired and expected in the vast majority of cases.
      But in containers syncing the local clock is usually impossible, but this
      shall not break the providing of NTP services to the network.
      To some extent this makes chrony's default config more similar to 'ntpd',
      which complained in syslog but still provided NTP server service in those
      cases.
      + debian/chrony.service: allow the service to run without CAP_SYS_TIME
      + debian/control: add new dependency libcap2-bin for capsh (usually
        installed anyway, but make them explicit to be sure).
      + debian/chrony.default: new option SYNC_IN_CONTAINER to not fall back
        (Default off).
      + debian/chronyd-starter.sh: wrapper to handle special cases in containers
        and if CAP_SYS_TIME is missing. Effectively allows to run NTP server in
        containers on a default installation and avoid failing to sync time (or
        if allowed to sync, avoid multiple containers to fight over it by
        accident).
      + debian/install: make chronyd-starter.sh available on install.
      + debian/docs, debian/README.container: provide documentation about the
        handling of this case.
    - d/postrm: re-establish systemd-timesyncd on removal (LP: 1764357)
    - Notify chrony to update sources in response to systemd-networkd
      events (LP: 1718227)

chrony (2.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Import upstream version 2.4:
    - Please see /usr/share/doc/chrony/changelog.gz for the release notes.

  * debian/chrony.if-{up,post-down}:
    - New scripts used to put chronyd online/offline depending on the
    state of the connection. (Closes: #240528,#312092,#389961)

  * debian/chrony.keys:
    - Highlight “chronyc keygen” command to generate keys.

  * debian/chrony.ppp.ip-down:
    - Be sure that there is no default route before going offline.
    (Closes: #252131)

  * debian/control:
    - Remove install-info dependency.
    - Remove texinfo build dependency since documentation in Texinfo format
    has been dropped upstream.
    - Build depend on asciidoctor ≥ 1.5.3-1~. The version constraint is
    important since chrony’s man pages are generated from “adoc” files, a
    functionality that has been added in asciidoctor 1.5.3.

  * debian/dirs:
    - Add “etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d”.

  * debian/doc-base:
    - Remove the file since we do not generate chrony.{html,txt} anymore.

  * debian/docs:
    - Remove references to chrony.{html,txt}.

    - Drop fix-ftbfs-on-powerpc-ppc64-ppc64el.diff; applied upstream.
    - Update the “series” file accordingly.

  * debian/postinst:

  * debian/watch:
    - Use HTTPS to fetch new upstream releases.
    - Switch to version 4 format.

    architectures.

 -- Vincent Blut <vincent.debian@free.fr>  Fri, 20 May 2016 14:21:14 +0200

chrony (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Import upstream version 2.3:
    - Please see /usr/share/doc/chrony/changelog.gz for the release notes.
    (Closes: #818235)

  * debian/chrony.conf:
    - Drop the “logchange” directive. Upstream has enabled “logchange” by
    default with a threshold of 1 second. We now use that instead of our custom
    threshold of 0,5 second which tended to spam syslog.
    - Remove obsolete comment.

  * debian/chrony.lintian-overrides:
    - Update “chrony.keys” path

  * debian/control:
    - Bump standard-version to 3.9.8 (no changes required).

    (Closes: #820087)

  * debian/postrm:
    - Remove chrony.keys on purge.
    - Remove all vestiges of chrony.keys from the state hashfile.

  * debian/rules:
    - Re-enable test suite.
    - Remove dh_installinit override. The init script is LSB-compliant so
    passing the “default” option or the two-digit sequence number is unneeded.
    - Explicitly set the NTP era. With this change, the NTP time will be
    mapped from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to 2106-02-07T06:28:16Z. Thanks to this
    fixed value, chrony build should be reproducible.
    - Move the key file template (chrony.keys) in /usr/share/chrony.
    - Force /usr/share/chrony/chrony.keys to use 0640 modes.

 -- Vincent Blut <vincent.debian@free.fr>  Wed, 18 May 2016 23:13:05 +0200

chrony (2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Import upstream versions 2.2 and 2.2.1:

    Unix domain command socket in chrony 2.2.
    - Fix keyfile directive commentary.

  * debian/chrony.keys:
    - New file template.

  * debian/chrony.lintian-overrides:
    - New file used to force lintian to stop complaining about the “chrony.keys”
    file modes (0640).

  * debian/chrony.ppp.ip-down:
    - Drop obsolete authentication method to the chronyd daemon. This is now
    handled by the usage of a Unix domain command socket.

  * debian/chrony.ppp.ip-up:
    - Drop obsolete authentication method to the chronyd daemon. This is now
    handled by the usage of a Unix domain command socket.
    - Reinstate the “burst” chronyc command.

  * debian/control:
    - Build depend on libseccomp-dev ≥ 2.2.3-3~. We need it to provide syscall
    filtering.
    - Fix a typo relative to the name of an architecture.
    - Build depend on pkg-config.
    - Restrict libcap-dev build dependency on Linux only.
    - Depend on iproute2 instead of net-tools.
    - Drop timelimit dependency.
    - Update Vcs-Git to use HTTPS.

    - Drop obsolete authentication method from the putonline() function.
    - Fix indentation issue in the putonline() function.

  * debian/logrotate:
    - Do not pass the “-a” option to chronyc, it’s no longer necessary.

  * debian/NEWS:
    - Add a comment about the command key suppression from the “chrony.keys”
    file.

  * debian/patches/:
    - Drop 01_do-not-install-copying-file.patch, not needed anymore.
      ↳ Remove reference to that patch from the series file.

  * debian/postinst:
    - Do not create an ID/key pair for command authentication. Configuration
    and monitoring via chronyc is now done using Unix domain socket accessible
    by root or by the system user to which chronyd will drop root privileges,
    i.e. _chrony.

  * debian/postrm:
    - Remove /var/lib/chrony content only on purge. (Closes: #568492)

  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Drop obsolete statement.

  * debian/rules:
    - Build with --enable-scfilter.
    - Install the “chrony.keys” file in /etc/chrony/ with 0640 modes.

  * debian/:
    - Rename ppp scripts from ip-{up,down} to chrony.ppp.ip-{up,down}.
    Necessary to let dh_installppp do its magic.

  * debian/chrony.conf:
    - Use the new 'pool' directive to specify the pool of NTP servers.
    - Use the iburst option to speed up the initial synchronization.
    - Drop the minpoll option. There is no point to deviate from upstream here.
    Consequently, the default minimum polling interval is now 64 seconds
    instead of 256 seconds.
    - Enable kernel synchronization of the RTC via the 'rtcsync' directive.
    - Drop the commented out 'rtcfile' directive in the configuration file.
    - Stricly act as an NTP client by default. Serving time to other systems
    should be the decision of the administrator(s). (Closes: #778770)
    - Clarify some comments.
    - Improve comment about the 'commandkey' directive.

  * debian/control:

chrony (1.24-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed regression that caused default CHRONY_IOC_ lines to
    vanish from io_linux.h thereby breaking hppa and ia64.

    Closes: #588930: FTBFS [ia64,hppa]: "I don't know the values of the
    _IOC_* constants on your architecture"

  * $remote_fs was added in 1.24-1.  Depending on networking is neither

chrony (1.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  The scripts will be rewritten and many more bugs

chrony (1.23-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Commented out rtcfile directive in chrony.conf because it can cause
    lockups with certain combinations of motherboard and kernel (this is
    a known kernel bug).

    Closes: #508298: chronyd unreachable and does not work (clock drifts)

  * Chrony no longer uses the ppp/ip-up.d and ppp/ip-up.d files and the new
    init.d file won't hang if chronyc hangs.

    Closes: #448481: /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony doesn't work when bindaddress is set.

  * Cannot reproduce on current version on amd64.

    bug but forgot to close the bug.

    Closes: #392273: Recursive dependency disease: chrony shouldn't depend on ncurses

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sun, 09 Nov 2008 20:19:22 -0600

chrony (1.23-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dependency of init script on Pppconfig ip-up.d script by moving
    those lines into the init script.

  * Added checks to try to make sure that Chronyd is really, really running.
    Changed Netstat call to use -n, added code to kill it if it hangs.
    Added code to kill Chronyc if it can't contact Chronyd.
    Discussed the HPET/rtc problem in NEWS.Debian.

    Closes: #504000: init script hangs for a while might break upgrade

  * Added missing initialization to create_instance() in ntp_core.c.
    This was why UTI_NormaliseTimeval() was being called with huge
    values at times.

  * See comment on #195620 in 1.21z-6 below.  If you know of more LP64
    bugs reopen #348412 with a patch.

    Closes: #348412: chronyc not LP64 compliant

  * Added comment about sources being discarded to chrony.conf as suggested
    by Andreas Hübner in  #268289.

  * This is normal behavior.

    Closes: #287060: trimrtc takes 40 seconds to take effect

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Thu, 06 Nov 2008 10:38:58 -0600

chrony (1.23-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rewrote UTI_NormaliseTimeval()in util.c to use divide/remainder
    instead of loops at the suggestion of Gabor Gombas.  This prevents the
    problem of the loop running until the sun goes out when the function
    is called with a very large value for tv_usec on 64-bit architectures.
    Also fixed some other spots where the same loop was being used.

    Closes: #474294 Goes into endless loop
    Closes: #447011 chronyd stalls with 100% CPU usage

    I still don't know why the function is being called with such a
    large value, however.

  * Changed default servers in chrony,conf to Debian servers.

    Closes: #434483: chrony: Should use NTP servers in Debian pool

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Apr 2008 11:47:44 -0500

  * New upstream release
    This is 1.23 with Debian patches applied (including some for LP64).
    I'm uploading this to Experimental to get it tested on x86_64 to see
    if  #474294 is fixed.

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2008 14:49:15 -0500

chrony (1.21z-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches from Eric Lammerts <eric@lammerts.org> and Goswin von
    Brederlow <brederlo@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de> to cast the value
    returned by ntohl to int32_t and so cause correct sign-extension near
    line 1655 in client.c.  Also fixed similar bugs in the same area.  I'm
    not sure this entirely fixes the chronyc number display problem,
    though.  I've not closed #348412 here because chrony is still not
    fully LP64 compliant.
    Closes: #195620: Strange "System time : xxx seconds slow of
    NTP time" output

  * Replaced addrfilt.c with addrfilt.c from upstream git repository.
    This fixes the recursive structure definition problems.

  * Replaced 'route' with 'netstat -r' in the initscript.

  * Applied patch for configure script from Nathanael Nerode
    <neroden@gcc.gnu.org> to delete the superfluous "lncurses" at line
    327.
    Closes: #392273: Recursive dependency disease: chrony shouldn't depend
    on ncurses

  * Added test to reject servers claiming stratum less than 1 in
    ntp_core.c "Test 7".  Bill Unruh <unruh@physics.ubc.ca> has run across
    a server that sometimes claims to be stratum 0, which causes
    considerable confusion.

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Feb 2007 17:47:40 -0600

chrony (1.21z-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Applied postinst patch from Lionel Elie Mamane to test for the
    existence of old .keys and .conf files before renaming them.
    Closes: #397759: fails to configure: mv: cannot stat `/etc/chrony/chrony.keys.1.21-2':
    No such file or directory

  * Added burst command to /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony to give chronyd a kick in the butt.
    Shouldn't need that, though.
    Initscript now calls /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony if a default route exists.
    Closes: #397739: Not connecting to sources after reboot - dialup

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Nov 2006 08:07:20 -0600

    Closes: #390280: chrony: missing dependency on mail

  * Added LSB headers to initscript

  * Corrected erroneous use of 'dpkg --compare-version' in preinst and postinst.
    Closes: #386733: fails to configure (bad upgrade check)

  * Added rm to postinst to remove keyfile possibly left by a failed install.
    Closes: #390278: usage of tempfile /etc/chrony/chrony.keys is doubtful

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Oct 2006 13:39:49 -0500

chrony (1.21z-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed upstream version number from 1.21 to 1.21z to satisfy Debian
    archive software.

  * Replaced impure chrony_1.21.orig.tar.gz.
    Closes: #340030: chrony: Tarball is impure

  * Now Provides, Conflicts, Replaces time-daemon
    Closes: #330839: time-daemon pseudopackage

  * Corrected typos.
    Closes: #321121: chrony: typo in 'Conflicts:' field: s/ntpsimple/ntp-simple/ and s/ntprefclock/ntp-refclock/

  * Deleted last few lines of chrony.conf as they no longer apply.

  * Deleted .arch-ids from contrib and examples.

  * Fixed typo in chronyc.1
    Closes: #349871: chrony: typo in chrnoyc.1 results in missing word

  * Corrected references in man pages.
    Closes: #345034: chrony: man pages refer to wrong sections

  * Added "allow 172.16/12" to chrony.conf.
    Closes: #252952: chrony: default allow should also have 172.16/12

  * Channged server lines in chrony.conf to follow ntp.org current recommendation.
    Closes: #243534: chrony: new pool.ntp.org setup doesn't work well

  * Fixed FSF address in debian/copyright.

    Closes: #328292: New version of chrony avalaible

  * Enabled RTC as upstream has installed a work-around for the HPET bug.

  * Switched to libreadline5.
    Closes: #326379: please rebuild with libreadline5-dev as build dependency

  * Patched addrfilt.c to fix gcc 4.0 build problem.
    Closes: #298709: chrony: FTBFS (amd64/gcc-4.0): array type has incomplete element type

  * There are lots more minor things to fix but I'm uploading now to close

chrony (1.20-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added test for /usr/bin/mail in postinst.
    Closes: #307061: Install failure: Cannot configure on system without mailx
    I consider this bug serious because it can cause installation to fail
    and so I want to get the fix into Sarge.

  * Fixed typo in chrony.conf, replaced '/etc/init.d/chrony restart'
    with 'invoke-rc.d chrony restart'.
    Closes: #305090: Typo in chrony.conf, should mention invoke-rc.d

  * Added README.Debian explaining that rtc is off by default.

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Apr 2005 18:47:30 -0500

chrony (1.20-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added info-4 to debian/rules.
    Closes: #287142: chrony: Can't find chrony.info-4

  * Corrected "See Also" section in chrony man page.  Now mentions
    chronyc(1), chronyd(8), and chrony.conf(5).
    Closes: #287444: chrony.1.gz: SEE ALSO on man page has wrong section.

  * Edited chrony.conf to disable rtc by default and explain why:
    on some systems that use genrtc or the HPET real-time clock it
    fails and causes chronyd to fill up the log.  The failure is
    probably due to a kernel bug, bug the logging should be
    throttled.

  * Added more explanatory comments at the servers directive in
    chrony.conf.

  * The postinst script now sends a message to root saying where the
    password is, whether Chrony is assuming UTC or local time,
    that rtc updating is disabled, why, and how to change it.

  * Added missing '#' to
    "Can't tell how your clock is set: assuming local time."
    in postinst.

chrony (1.19-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes: #179842 "CROAK" redefined
    Added '#undef CROAK' before CROAK redefiniton in pktlength.h,
    added '-DALPHA' to 'alpha' condition in configure, added
    'ifdef ALPHA' around CROAK redefinition.
  * Replaced many signed and unsigned longs as well as some ints,
    shorts, and chars with stdint.h types in candm.h, md5.h, ntp.h,
    clientlog.h, and ntp_io.c.  This should fix all 64-bit problems.

    char but I think I got the only ones likely to cause trouble.
