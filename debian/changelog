chrony (3.2~pre1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Import upstream version 3.2-pre1:
    - Please see /usr/share/doc/chrony/changelog.gz for the release notes.

chrony (3.1-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/chrony.if-up:
    - Do not pass the “burst” command to chronyc as the script could return an
    error in certain situations. As a consequence, that would prevent ifupdown
    from writing the current state of the interfaces in /run/network/ifstate.
    Thanks to John Eikenberry <jae@zhar.net> for reporting that issue.
    (Closes: #868491)

  * debian/chrony.ppp.ip-up:
    - Take the same action as for the “chrony.if-up” script as a precautionary
    measure.

 -- Vincent Blut <vincent.debian@free.fr>  Mon, 17 Jul 2017 16:47:56 +0200

chrony (3.1-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now that Stretch has been released (\o/), let’s upload chrony 3.1 to
    unstable.

  * debian/:
    - Remove the menu file used to launch “chronyc”. It is a CLI only tool,
    thus it probably does not make a lot of sense to keep it in the Debian
    menu.

  * debian/control:
    - Drop dependency on pre-jessie util-linux version.
    - Bump standard-version to 4.0.0 (no changes required).

  * debian/tests/upstream-simulation-test-suite:
    - Fix the leading comment which mentioned “vm” despite the fact that the
    test runs in a container.

 -- Vincent Blut <vincent.debian@free.fr>  Mon, 19 Jun 2017 02:30:10 +0200

  * debian/chrony.ppp.ip-up:
    - Don’t create “/var/run/chrony-ppp-up” file after the ppp link came up.
    - Check for pid file existence instead of calling “pidof”.
    - Don’t call “chronyc” using its absolute path.
    - Check for the presence of a default route before advising “chronyd” that
    the network connectivity to the sources is ready.

  * debian/init:
    - Check if “$PIDFILE” exists before taking action.
    - Do not print informational messages.
    - Remove the “chronyd” pid file when stopping as it doesn’t do it on
    its own.
    - Rework the “restart|force-reload” pattern.
    - Make use of some init-functions.
    - Print a message if “chronyd” is already running while attempting to start
    it.
    - Do not delete “/var/run/chrony-ppp-up”, that file doesn’t exist anymore.

  * d/rules:
    - Move the default pid file from “/var/run” to “/run”.

  * d/tests/*:
    - Use autopkgtest facility to run the upstream simulation test suite.

  * debian/rules:
    - Specify default path to hwclock adjtime file.

chrony (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/chrony.conf:
    - Disable logging by default, it waste some disk space and users are
    probably better served by “chronyc sources” and “chronyc sourcestats”
    commands anyway.

  * debian/chrony.service:
    - Remove the “Restart=on-failure” option. There are possible security
    implications for NTP clients.

chrony (2.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/apm:

    it’s highly probable that it isn’t useful anymore.

  * debian/chrony.maintscript:
    - Remove the apm script’s conffile.

  * debian/chrony.service:
    - Supply a systemd service file.

    - Install the init-helper script in “/usr/lib/chrony”.

  * debian/rules:
    - Don’t install the now removed apm script.

 -- Vincent Blut <vincent.debian@free.fr>  Thu, 22 Dec 2016 02:16:54 +0100

chrony (2.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/chrony.conf:
    - Don’t create sample histories by default. Using that feature does not
    make a lot of sense when using a pool of rapidely rotating time servers.
    - Remove unused directives.
    - Improve (well, I hope! ;-) ) the configuration file readability.
    - Reword the driftfile directive commentary.
    - Shorten the lead-in comment.

    - Don’t pass the “-r” option when restarting chronyd as we have disabled
    the creation of sample histories by default.

  * debian/rules:
    - Drop dh_auto_build override. Nowadays, the documentation is built by
    default.

 -- Vincent Blut <vincent.debian@free.fr>  Fri, 9 Dec 2016 16:58:32 +0100

chrony (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Import upstream version 2.4:
    - Please see /usr/share/doc/chrony/changelog.gz for the release notes.

  * debian/chrony.if-{up,post-down}:
    - New scripts used to put chronyd online/offline depending on the
    state of the connection. (Closes: #240528,#312092,#389961)

  * debian/chrony.keys:
    - Highlight “chronyc keygen” command to generate keys.

  * debian/chrony.ppp.ip-down:
    - Be sure that there is no default route before going offline.
    (Closes: #252131)

  * debian/control:
    - Remove install-info dependency.
    - Remove texinfo build dependency since documentation in Texinfo format
    has been dropped upstream.
    - Build depend on asciidoctor ≥ 1.5.3-1~. The version constraint is
    important since chrony’s man pages are generated from “adoc” files, a
    functionality that has been added in asciidoctor 1.5.3.

  * debian/dirs:
    - Add “etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d”.

  * debian/doc-base:
    - Remove the file since we do not generate chrony.{html,txt} anymore.

  * debian/docs:
    - Remove references to chrony.{html,txt}.

  * debian/patches/*:
    - Drop fix-ftbfs-on-powerpc-ppc64-ppc64el.diff; applied upstream.
    - Update the “series” file accordingly.

  * debian/postinst:
    - Use ucfr to associate chrony with its configuration files. Suggested by
    Paul Gevers <elbrus@debian.org>

  * debian/postrm:
    - Remove all vestiges of the association between chrony and its
    configuration files. Also suggested by Paul Gevers <elbrus@debian.org>

  * debian/rules:
    - Provide upstream NetworkManager dispatcher script.

  * debian/watch:
    - Use HTTPS to fetch new upstream releases.
    - Switch to version 4 format.

chrony (2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cherry pick upstream patch to fix FTBFS on PowerPC, ppc64 and ppc64el
    architectures.

 -- Vincent Blut <vincent.debian@free.fr>  Fri, 20 May 2016 14:21:14 +0200

chrony (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Import upstream version 2.3:
    - Please see /usr/share/doc/chrony/changelog.gz for the release notes.
    (Closes: #818235)

  * debian/chrony.conf:
    - Drop the “logchange” directive. Upstream has enabled “logchange” by
    default with a threshold of 1 second. We now use that instead of our custom
    threshold of 0,5 second which tended to spam syslog.
    - Remove obsolete comment.

  * debian/chrony.lintian-overrides:
    - Update “chrony.keys” path

  * debian/control:
    - Bump standard-version to 3.9.8 (no changes required).

    (Closes: #820087)

  * debian/postrm:
    - Remove chrony.keys on purge.
    - Remove all vestiges of chrony.keys from the state hashfile.

  * debian/rules:
    - Re-enable test suite.
    - Remove dh_installinit override. The init script is LSB-compliant so
    passing the “default” option or the two-digit sequence number is unneeded.
    - Explicitly set the NTP era. With this change, the NTP time will be
    mapped from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to 2106-02-07T06:28:16Z. Thanks to this
    fixed value, chrony build should be reproducible.
    - Move the key file template (chrony.keys) in /usr/share/chrony.
    - Force /usr/share/chrony/chrony.keys to use 0640 modes.

 -- Vincent Blut <vincent.debian@free.fr>  Wed, 18 May 2016 23:13:05 +0200

chrony (2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Import upstream versions 2.2 and 2.2.1:

    Unix domain command socket in chrony 2.2.
    - Fix keyfile directive commentary.

  * debian/chrony.keys:
    - New file template.

  * debian/chrony.lintian-overrides:
    - New file used to force lintian to stop complaining about the “chrony.keys”
    file modes (0640).

  * debian/chrony.ppp.ip-down:
    - Drop obsolete authentication method to the chronyd daemon. This is now
    handled by the usage of a Unix domain command socket.

  * debian/chrony.ppp.ip-up:
    - Drop obsolete authentication method to the chronyd daemon. This is now
    handled by the usage of a Unix domain command socket.
    - Reinstate the “burst” chronyc command.

  * debian/control:
    - Build depend on libseccomp-dev ≥ 2.2.3-3~. We need it to provide syscall
    filtering.
    - Fix a typo relative to the name of an architecture.
    - Build depend on pkg-config.
    - Restrict libcap-dev build dependency on Linux only.
    - Depend on iproute2 instead of net-tools.
    - Drop timelimit dependency.
    - Update Vcs-Git to use HTTPS.
    - Bump standard-version to 3.9.7 (no changes required).

    - Drop obsolete authentication method from the putonline() function.
    - Fix indentation issue in the putonline() function.

  * debian/logrotate:
    - Do not pass the “-a” option to chronyc, it’s no longer necessary.

  * debian/NEWS:
    - Add a comment about the command key suppression from the “chrony.keys”
    file.

  * debian/patches/:
    - Drop 01_do-not-install-copying-file.patch, not needed anymore.
      ↳ Remove reference to that patch from the series file.

  * debian/postinst:
    - Do not create an ID/key pair for command authentication. Configuration
    and monitoring via chronyc is now done using Unix domain socket accessible
    by root or by the system user to which chronyd will drop root privileges,
    i.e. _chrony.

  * debian/postrm:
    - Remove /var/lib/chrony content only on purge. (Closes: #568492)

  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Drop obsolete statement.

  * debian/rules:
    - Build with --enable-scfilter.
    - Install the “chrony.keys” file in /etc/chrony/ with 0640 modes.

  * Import upstream version 2.0 and 2.1.1:
    - Please see /usr/share/doc/chrony/changelog.gz for the release notes.

  * debian/:
    - Rename ppp scripts from ip-{up,down} to chrony.ppp.ip-{up,down}.
    Necessary to let dh_installppp do its magic.

  * debian/chrony.conf:
    - Use the new 'pool' directive to specify the pool of NTP servers.
    - Use the iburst option to speed up the initial synchronization.
    - Drop the minpoll option. There is no point to deviate from upstream here.
    Consequently, the default minimum polling interval is now 64 seconds
    instead of 256 seconds.
    - Enable kernel synchronization of the RTC via the 'rtcsync' directive.
    - Drop the commented out 'rtcfile' directive in the configuration file.
    - Stricly act as an NTP client by default. Serving time to other systems
    should be the decision of the administrator(s). (Closes: #778770)
    - Clarify some comments.
    - Improve comment about the 'commandkey' directive.

  * debian/control:

    - Refresh 01_do-not-install-copying-file.patch.

  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Fix misleading information.

  * debian/rules:
    - No need to install ppp scripts from the 'rules' script. Let dh_installppp
    handle that.

chrony (1.23-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dependency of init script on Pppconfig ip-up.d script by moving
    those lines into the init script.
  
  * Added checks to try to make sure that Chronyd is really, really running.
    Changed Netstat call to use -n, added code to kill it if it hangs.
    Added code to kill Chronyc if it can't contact Chronyd.
    Discussed the HPET/rtc problem in NEWS.Debian.
  
    Closes: #504000: init script hangs for a while might break upgrade

  * Added missing initialization to create_instance() in ntp_core.c.
    This was why UTI_NormaliseTimeval() was being called with huge
    values at times.

  * See comment on #195620 in 1.21z-6 below.  If you know of more LP64
    bugs reopen #348412 with a patch.
  
    Closes: #348412: chronyc not LP64 compliant
  
  * Added comment about sources being discarded to chrony.conf as suggested
    by Andreas Hübner in  #268289.
  
  * This is normal behavior.

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Thu, 06 Nov 2008 10:38:58 -0600

chrony (1.23-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rewrote UTI_NormaliseTimeval()in util.c to use divide/remainder
    instead of loops at the suggestion of Gabor Gombas.  This prevents the
    problem of the loop running until the sun goes out when the function
    is called with a very large value for tv_usec on 64-bit architectures.
    Also fixed some other spots where the same loop was being used.
  
    Closes: #474294 Goes into endless loop
    Closes: #447011 chronyd stalls with 100% CPU usage
     
    I still don't know why the function is being called with such a 
    large value, however.

  * Changed default servers in chrony,conf to Debian servers.
  
    Closes: #434483: chrony: Should use NTP servers in Debian pool

    This is 1.23 with Debian patches applied (including some for LP64).
    I'm uploading this to Experimental to get it tested on x86_64 to see
    if  #474294 is fixed.
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2008 14:49:15 -0500

chrony (1.21z-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches from Eric Lammerts <eric@lammerts.org> and Goswin von
    Brederlow <brederlo@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de> to cast the value
    returned by ntohl to int32_t and so cause correct sign-extension near
    line 1655 in client.c.  Also fixed similar bugs in the same area.  I'm
    not sure this entirely fixes the chronyc number display problem,
    though.  I've not closed #348412 here because chrony is still not
    fully LP64 compliant.
    Closes: #195620: Strange "System time : xxx seconds slow of
    NTP time" output

  * Replaced addrfilt.c with addrfilt.c from upstream git repository.
    This fixes the recursive structure definition problems.

  * Replaced 'route' with 'netstat -r' in the initscript.

  * Applied patch for configure script from Nathanael Nerode
    <neroden@gcc.gnu.org> to delete the superfluous "lncurses" at line
    327.
    Closes: #392273: Recursive dependency disease: chrony shouldn't depend
    on ncurses

  * Added test to reject servers claiming stratum less than 1 in
    ntp_core.c "Test 7".  Bill Unruh <unruh@physics.ubc.ca> has run across
    a server that sometimes claims to be stratum 0, which causes
    considerable confusion.

    Closes: #397759: fails to configure: mv: cannot stat `/etc/chrony/chrony.keys.1.21-2':
    No such file or directory

  * Added burst command to /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony to give chronyd a kick in the butt.
    Shouldn't need that, though.
    Initscript now calls /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony if a default route exists.

    I consider this bug serious because it can cause installation to fail

    chronyc(1), chronyd(8), and chrony.conf(5).
    Closes: #287444: chrony.1.gz: SEE ALSO on man page has wrong section.
  
  * Edited chrony.conf to disable rtc by default and explain why:
    on some systems that use genrtc or the HPET real-time clock it
    fails and causes chronyd to fill up the log.  The failure is
    probably due to a kernel bug, bug the logging should be
    throttled.
  
  * Added more explanatory comments at the servers directive in 
    chrony.conf.
  
  * The postinst script now sends a message to root saying where the
    password is, whether Chrony is assuming UTC or local time,
    that rtc updating is disabled, why, and how to change it.
  
  * Added missing '#' to
    "Can't tell how your clock is set: assuming local time."
    in postinst.
