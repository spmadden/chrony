Upstream has fixed the HPET error message problem so updating of the
real-time clock has been enabled.  However, RTC may still not work on
systems with HPET: it just won't flood the log.

The 'z' in the version number did not originate upstream.  I had to add
it to satisfy the Debian archive software after I corrected my error of
uploading an impure tarball.
