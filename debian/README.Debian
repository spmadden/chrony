chrony for DEBIAN
----------------------

 I made the following changes to the chrony distribution to package it for
 Debian:

 Added /etc/chrony and moved the config files there from /etc.  This the
 only change to the source code.
 
 Added a few lines to the info files explaining how the Debian installation
 differs from the standard one.  I also used texi2html to generate html
 docs.

 Created default /etc/chrony/chrony.conf, /etc/chrony/chrony.keys,
 /etc/init.d/chrony, /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony, /etc/cron.weekly/chrony, and
 /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/chrony files and arranged for them to be installed
 automatically.

 Arranged for a random password to be generated at installation time and
 installed in chrony.keys as key 1 (unless chrony.keys already has
 something in it).  You may change this password if you wish.

 The standard Debian chrony installation is designed for systems with an
 intermittent dial-up connection.  If you have such a system the most you
 should need to do is edit /etc/chrony/chrony.conf a bit.  If you do not
 you should read the documentation and create an appropriate configuration
 (you should read the documentation anyway).

 The standard Debian installation does not use the real time clock
 facilities.  If you want to use them you will need to edit the config
 files and scripts. You will also need to make sure hwclock (util-linux
 package) is kept out of chrony's way (see the hwclock README files in 
 the util-linux documentation for more information).

 The scripts /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony, /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/chrony, and
 /etc/cron.weekly/chrony read key 1 from /etc/chrony/chrony.keys and use it
 as the password to send chronyc commands.  Thus you can change the
 password by changing this key, but if you make the command key anything
 but 1 these scripts won't work without editing.

 As installed, chronyd will be started on bootup and will attempt to
 contact the default server whenever you connect to your ISP.

 Use 'info chrony' to read the complete documentation.
