This is a collection of simulation tests. They use clknetsim to simulate
multiple systems connected in a network. It's available at

https://github.com/mlichvar/clknetsim

If this directory doesn't have a clknetsim subdirectory, a known working
revision will be downloaded and compiled automatically.

Currently it runs only on Linux.

The tests are written in bash and they can be run directly. The ./run script
runs all tests.
