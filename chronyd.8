.TH CHRONYD 8 "August 10, 2001" chrony "System Administration"
.SH NAME
chronyd \- chrony background daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chronyd
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIchrony\fR is a pair of programs for maintaining the accuracy of computer
clocks. \fBchronyd\fR is a background daemon program that can be started at boot
time.

\fBchronyd\fR is a daemon which runs in background on the
system.  It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the
system's offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system
time accordingly.  For isolated systems, the user can periodically
enter the correct time by hand (using \fIchronyc\fR).  In either case,
\fBchronyd\fR determines the rate at which the computer
gains or loses time, and compensates for this.

.SH USAGE
\fBchronyd\fR is usually started at boot-time and requires superuser
priviliges.

If \fBchronyd\fR has been installed to its default location
\fI/usr/local/sbin/chronyd\fR, starting it is simply a matter of entering the
command:

\fI/usr/local/sbin/chronyd\fR

Information messages and warnings will be logged to syslog.


.SH OPTIONS
A summary of the options supported by \fBchronyd\fR is included below.

.TP
.B \-d
When run in this mode, the program will not detach itself from the
terminal, and all messages will be sent to the terminal instead of
to syslog.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIconf-file\fR
This option can be used to specify an alternate location for the
configuration file (default \fI/etc/chrony/chrony.conf\fR).
.TP
.B \-r
This option will reload sample histories for each of the servers being used.
These histories are created by using the \fIdump\fR command in \fIchronyc\fR,
or by setting the \fIdumponexit\fR directive in the configuration file.  This
option is useful if you want to stop and restart \fBchronyd\fR briefly for any
reason, e.g. to install a new version.  However, it only makes sense on
systems where the kernel can maintain clock compensation whilst not under
\fBchronyd\fR's control.  The only version where this happens so far is Linux.
On systems where this is not the case, e.g. Solaris and SunOS the option
should not be used.
.TP
.B \-s
This option will set the system clock from the computer's real-time
clock.  This is analogous to supplying the \fI-s\fR flag to the
\fI/sbin/clock\fR program during the Linux boot sequence.

Support for real-time clocks is limited at present - the criteria
are described in the section on the \fIrtcfile\fR directive in the
documentation supplied with the distribution.

If \fBchronyd\fR cannot support the real time clock on your computer,
this option cannot be used and a warning message will be logged to
the syslog.

If used in conjunction with the \fB-r\fR flag, \fBchronyd\fR will attempt
to preserve the old samples after setting the system clock from
the real time clock.  This can be used to allow \fBchronyd\fR to
perform long term averaging of the gain or loss rate across system
reboots, and is useful for dial-up systems that are shut down when
not in use.  For this to work well, it relies on \fBchronyd\fR having
been able to determine accurate statistics for the difference
between the real time clock and system clock last time the
computer was on.
.TP
.B \-v
This option displays \fBchronyd\fR's version number to the terminal and exits
