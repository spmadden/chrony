.TH chrony.conf 5 "August 10, 2001" chrony "Configuration Files"
.SH NAME
chrony.conf \- chronyd configuration file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/chrony.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIchrony\fR is a pair of programs for maintaining the accuracy of computer
clocks. \fIchronyd\fR is a background daemon program that can be started at
boot time.

Assuming that you have found some servers, you need to set up a
configuration file to run \fIchrony\fR.  The (compiled-in) default location
for this file is \fB/etc/chrony.conf\fR.  Assuming that your ntp servers
are called `a.b.c' and `d.e.f', your \fBchrony.conf\fR file could contain
as a minimum

     server a.b.c
     server d.e.f
     server g.h.i

However, you will probably want to include some of the other directives
described in detail in the documentation supplied with the distribution
(\fIchrony.txt\fR and \fIchrony.texi\fR). The following directives will be
particularly useful : `driftfile', `commandkey', `keyfile'.  The smallest
useful configuration file would look something like

     server a.b.c
     server d.e.f
     server g.h.i
     keyfile /etc/chrony/chrony.keys
     commandkey 1
     driftfile /etc/chrony/chrony.drift
